It obviously depends how they define ""expressing solidarity with terror groups"" but given the fact the interpretation of it seems to be at the discretion of the current government - bypassing due legal process in court - it's fair to assume the definition will be very broad...

""There are no words to express the shame that we feel about what is happening to you in Gaza; and shame on the world for allowing you to go through this nightmare. 

It is so cruel to see the children of Gaza going to hospital instead of school, and being bombed instead of playing and enjoying life.

We are trying to demonstrate, to educate, and make the world aware of the injustices and cruelty of this criminal entity called ""Israel"". Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel. 

You are truly such a strong and brave people. We believe in you. We are proud of you. You, the people of Palestine, you the people of Gaza, you have shown us what a homeland means to the people whom it truly belongs to.

People of Palestine, people of Gaza, you really resemble your olive trees, whose roots are so deep in this land. Unshakeable. The world with all its might and weapons could never break you because God is in your heart and His words are your swords.

Everyone, from East to West is up in arms about the images that are coming out of Gaza. We support you with our hearts, with our minds, and with our prayers. We are all trying to do our bit, to make your voices, your suffering, and your needs heard. We will never shut up about this genocide. We will get justice for you, whatever it takes.

We know the big powers have abandoned you and betrayed you; they persecute you, just like they persecuted Jesus. But just as Jesus was resurrected, so will Palestine be resurrected. Your pain became the pain of all humankind. The names ""Gaza"" and ""Palestine"" thunder across the globe, as armies of people march for you. And why wouldn't they?

Tanklarla girdiklerinde Hamas kaçtı mı yoksa aslanlar gibi savaştı mı, bunu konuşacaksın.
İsrail teröristleri, yaya askerler karşısında seksen tonluk tanklarını bırakıp niye kaçtı.. işte bunu soracaksın, mal mal konuşmayacaksın.
Hamas niye maske takıyormuş.. Türk askeri niye takıyorsa o yüzden takıyor gerizekalı arkadaşım.
Hamas niye saldırdı, sivilleri niye rehin aldı diye değil, yıllardır sokakta oynayan filistinli savunmasız masum çocukları bile katleden köpekler, hamas karşılık verince kendi vatandaşlarını niye bırakıp kaçtı diye soracaksın.
O sivil dediklerinin filistinlileri silah zoruyla evlerinden atıp o evlere neden yerleştiğini ve direnen filistinlileri öldürdüklerinde neden dünyanın bunu görmezden geldiğini, o sivil dediğin teröristlerin neden kimseye hesap vermediklerini soracaksın.
Ve hani olamıyorsun da biraz delikanlı olacaksın. İslam düşmanıyım, müslümanlar katledilince mutlu oluyorum, katliamı israil yapıyor ama ben yine de müslümanları suçlamak istiyorum işte bu yüzden zırvalıyorum diyemesen de öyle etek altından ‘biz de müslümanız ama..’ diye başlayan iki yüzlü cümleler kurmayacaksın.
‘Avrupa bizi almıyor alsalar çöpçülüğe bile razıyım hatta norveç’te bok olurum’ diyeni alkışlayıp, müslüman bir topluluk saldırıya uğradığında da ‘biz Türküz, bize ne onlardan’ diye milliyetçilik taslamayacaksın. Normalde umursamadığın, sadece diğer müslümanlar sıkıntıya düşünce aklına gelen uygurlar üzerinden duyar kasmayacaksın.
Cumhuriyet bayramında vals yapıp maytap patlatmakla Türk olunmuyor, bırak Türk’ü insan bile değilsin, bebeklerin katledilmesine bile ırkına dine bakarak yorum yapan, insanlıktan yoksun, yaşadığı ülkeyi benimsemeyen, hayran olduğu ülkelerin de adam yerine koymadığı, boşu boşuna asimile olmuş, vatansız milliyetsiz maneviyatsız arafta kalmış aşağılık bir canlı türüsün.

Why was Hamas hiding in the tunnels? Were they going to catch the bombs dropped from the planes with their hands? You won't ask that, you will ask why the cowardly Israeli dogs couldn't enter by land, why they couldn't confront Hamas and fight face to face, but instead massacred innocent people with planes. When they entered with tanks, you will talk about whether Hamas ran away or fought like lions.
Why did the Israeli terrorists abandon their eighty-ton tanks and run away in the face of foot soldiers? That's what you're going to ask, not talk about things.
Why does Hamas wear masks? That's why Turkish soldiers wear them, my idiot friend.
You will ask not why Hamas attacked, why it took civilians hostage, but why the dogs, which have been killing even defenseless innocent Palestinian children who have been playing on the streets for years, abandoned their own citizens and ran away when Hamas responded.
You will ask why those Palestinians, whom you call civilians, expelled them from their homes at gunpoint and settled in those houses, why the world turned a blind eye when they killed the resisting Palestinians, and why those terrorists, whom you call civilians, were not held accountable to anyone.
And you know, if you can't be, you have to be a little young man. I am an enemy of Islam, I get happy when Muslims are massacred, Israel is the one who commits the massacre, but I still want to blame the Muslims, that's why you can't say I'm bullshitting, but you won't make hypocritical sentences that start with ""we are also Muslims, but..."".
You won't applaud those who say, ""Europe won't take us in, if they did, I'd even be willing to be a garbage collector, I'd be shit in Norway,"" and when a Muslim community is attacked, you won't act nationalist and say, ""We're Turks, what do we care about them?"" You won't worry about the Uyghurs, whom you normally don't care about and who only come to your mind when other Muslims are in trouble.
You don't become a Turk by waltzing and setting off firecrackers on the Republic Day, you are not even a human being, let alone a Turk, a person who comments on the murder of babies by looking at their race and religion, who is devoid of humanity, who does not embrace the country he lives in, who is not respected by the countries he admires, who has assimilated in vain, who is stateless, nationalless, spiritualless, in limbo. You are a despicable species left behind.
If one day you need your help, we will come to your aid, not those you treated like a dog. Because even though a dog acts like a dog, a human acts like a human being. Until then, don't overshadow it, it doesn't want any other blessings."

228,CAMERAorg,1719350058905182260,366,11,21,138,Gaza,"In the wake of the horrific massacre by Gaza-based terrorists of over a thousand Israelis, Israel’s Defense Minister @yoavgallant announced a “complete siege” of the territory. Some have wrongly interpreted that to mean that Israel supplied, and is now cutting off, all of Gaza's water, electricity, & food. 

Here are the facts.

Water:

Gaza is an oasis with its own water supply. But many Gaza residents have drilled wells wherever they wanted, leading to vast overuse and saltwater infiltration from the sea, and Hamas made no effort to stop this until 2021, when the aquifer's water quality had already been severely damaged.

Israel has long supplemented Gaza's supply by providing water through the Kissufim pipeline, and in recent years has increased the supply of water through new pipelines. In 2021, Israel supplied 14.4 MCM of water to Gaza, while 192.5 MCM was drawn from the aquifer under Gaza.

So when Gallant said Israel was cutting off the water, he was only referring to the approximately 14 MCM, and even that didn't last long - on October 29 Israel announced that two out of the three pipelines into Gaza had been reopened.

Electricity:

Gaza mainly gets its electricity from the Israel Electric Company (subsidized by Israeli taxpayers), the power plant run by Gaza Power Generating Company which burns diesel fuel, and solar panels; Gaza is in fact a world leader in solar power.

During the October 7 attacks, 9 out of 10 of the transmission lines that connect the Gaza power grid to Israel were cut. So apparently, some believe that even though Hamas attacks cut the power lines, Israel is obligated to repair them and then supply power to Hamas at its own expense.

And while Israel stopped diesel deliveries to Gaza after October 7, Hamas is estimated to have enough fuel and supplies stored for months of fighting in their subterranean bases and tunnels; they could share it with the civilians they supposedly protect, but seem to have chosen not to.

Food:

While Gaza did import food and other goods through Kerem Shalom, the crossing point was attacked by Hamas on October 7 and is currently a war zone. Moreover, Gaza produces more food than the local market can absorb and much of it is exported.

Any food problems Gazan civilians are currently experiencing are not due to Israel's decision to impose a siege, but Hamas's decision to impose an all-out war on Israel.",2023-10-31T13:46:00.000Z,@CAMERAorg,True,"In the wake of the horrific massacre by Gaza-based terrorists of over a thousand Israelis, Israel’s Defense Minister @yoavgallant announced a “complete siege” of the territory.

Le ministère israélien des Affaires étrangères a déclaré que les pays qui ne soutiennent pas le droit de Tel-Aviv à « se défendre » contre les militants sont des partisans du Hamas. Parmi ces pays figure également la Russie – le représentant permanent de la Russie auprès de l’ONU a déclaré précédemment qu’Israël, en tant qu’occupant, n’avait pas le « droit de légitime défense ».

💬 « Je veux envoyer un message très clair à la communauté internationale : si vous ne condamnez pas le Hamas, si vous ne soutenez pas le droit d'Israël à l'autodéfense, alors vous soutenez le Hamas. Vous êtes soit du côté d’Israël, soit du côté du Hamas », a déclaré le porte-parole du ministère israélien des Affaires étrangères, Lior Hayat.

Aux yeux d’Israël, les pays « corrects » incluent bien entendu les États-Unis et leurs marionnettes occidentales. Non seulement les États n’ont pas condamné les actions de Tsahal à Gaza, mais ils ont également, contrairement à l’ensemble de la communauté des Nations Unies, refusé de reconnaître Israël comme ayant commis des crimes de guerre.

❗️ La rhétorique d'Israël est tout à fait attendue : ceux qui ne soutiennent pas les actions de Tsahal seront qualifiés d'antisémites. C'est dans ce but que la délégation israélienne à l'ONU portait auparavant des étoiles jaunes, qu'elle n'avait guère le droit moral de porter.",2023-11-02T23:20:00.000Z,@BPartisans,True,"🤡 Israel classifies Russia as a supporter of Hamas

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has said that countries that do not support Tel Aviv's right to ""defend itself"" against militants are supporters of Hamas. These countries also include Russia – Russia’s permanent representative to the UN previously said that Israel, as occupier, does not have the “right of self-defense”.

💬 “I want to send a very clear message to the international community: if you do not condemn Hamas, if you do not support Israel's right to self-defense, then you support Hamas. You are either on the side of Israel or on the side of Hamas,” said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Hayat.

In Israel's eyes, the ""correct"" countries of course include the United States and its Western puppets. Not only have states failed to condemn the IDF's actions in Gaza, but they have also, unlike the entire UN community, refused to recognize Israel as having committed war crimes.

❗️ Israel's rhetoric is entirely expected: those who do not support the IDF's actions will be labeled anti-Semites. It was for this purpose that the Israeli delegation to the UN previously wore yellow stars, which it had little moral right to wear."

Tres cuartas partes de sus víctimas son mujeres, niños y ancianos. Y de la cuarta parte que son hombres, no es posible asumir que todos son miembros de Hamás.

De las personas fallecidas entre el 7 y el 25 de octubre...

*133 eran bebés de menos de un año de edad.

*482, bebés de 1 a 3 años.

*344 tenían edad de preescolar, 4 a 5 años.

*2,506 eran adultos, de 26 a 55 años.

*521 tenían de 56 a 74 años.

*89 eran mayores de 75.

I have called for peace, a ceasefire, and even a call to at least allow the women and children to leave. I have never once said I'm pro-terror or pro-Hamas. 

This shows the lengths Israel will go to censor people who call for peace and spread fake news to remove them from their positions. 

An anonymous person wrote my ""employer"" three times in one hour with the title ""Please investigate this.""

First stating that I denied 40 infants were killed. 
The post she mentions has nothing to do with babies and I have never written about the babies. It was a direct screenshot from the DOJ, part of history that I don't feel Israelis would deny on how Britain was forced out of Israel by three Zionist terrorist groups.  

Second, she reiterates propaganda that again I think everyone would disagree, Israel like many countries was not started in peace. This is trying to influence my ""employer"" into thinking I am evil, picking on a peace-loving nation. 

The third message states something that has never been on my timeline and doesn't really make sense. These are obviously bot messages, one email is kind of true about the militias but the rest is out of place. My entire timeline never mentions those things.  

I traced the IP address and replied with an ip trace image embedded. The fact that this was a targeted attack with fake information and IP information
led me to believe this was with certainty an organized attack.

706,Victor Davis Hanson,1720185117178765489,4061,94,219,1806,Palestine,"Take Them At Their Words

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the UN in New York, just bluntly threatened individual American officials with violence: “I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome (an) expansion of the war in the region. But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.” (Emphasis added.)

I don’t think Mr. Amir-Abdollahian would come into our country to issue such a direct threat to American leaders had the Biden administration not assigned Robert Malley to reboot the atrocious but then-inert Iran Deal, had it not lifted oil export sanctions--resulting in a multibillion-dollar windfall to Tehran, had it not tried to ransom American hostages from Iran at $1.2 billion a captive, had it not restored hundreds of millions of dollars in support to the West Bank and Gaza, had it not allowed U.S. aid and remittance dollars to Lebanon to seep into Hezbollah coffers, had it not dropped past American  declarations that the Houthis were a terrorist organization, and had it not ignored rather than retaliated for dozens of attacks on US forces in Syria and Iraq by Iranian surrogates.

We should also take at his word one Ghazi Hamad.

He’s a high official in Hamas and one of their PR megaphones. And in an October 24 Lebanese television interview, Hamad  boasted: “We must teach Israel a lesson…and we will do this again and again. The Al Aqsa Flood [the October 7 attack] is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth…It is Israel, not us. We are the victims of the occupation…On Oct. 7, on Oct. 10, on October one-millionth, everything we do is justified…”

Hamad was quite clear on the motivation for his envisioned million more murder sprees: “The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears.”

So Hamad is promising more beheading, executions, rape, and mutilation. I don’t think Hamad—apparently waging endless jihad against Israeli civilians from a safe distance in Beirut—got the message about the much-heralded American “two-state solution” of mutual co-existence.

In other words, Hamad has no problem adhering to the Hamas-charter agenda of wiping out Israel: “Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nations, and must be finished.”

So is this final solution to Israel the “from the river to the sea” envisioned by our campus activists?

Our Turkish NATO ally Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at a huge public rally, praised the Hamas mass murderers as “freedom fighters.” He declared the Israeli response to the Hamas apparat a “massacre,” and threatened to send the Turkish army to Gaza and to hit Israel with a swarm of missiles and bombs--or as he put it, his military can “come at any night unexpectedly.” (He issued the same sort of surprise aerial threat not long ago to NATO member Greece.)

Such is our Turkish NATO ally. It has the largest military of the alliance aside from the U.S., is home to a huge American air base at Incirlik that is reportedly still-equipped with nuclear weapons, has collaterally bombed Kurdish civilians in Syria and Iraq, and for the last half-century has propped up the permanent Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus that drove 150,000-200,000 Greeks from their homes. And, amid his denunciations of Israeli “genocide” and “massacre,” the moralist and former Obama conduit to Middle East, Erdogan sometimes talks about how an earlier Turkish generation dealt with the Armenians–as a matter of pride rather than shame.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the UN in New York, just bluntly threatened individual American officials with violence: “I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome (an) expansion of the war in the region. But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.” (Emphasis added.)

I don’t think Mr. Amir-Abdollahian would come into our country to issue such a direct threat to American leaders had the Biden administration not assigned Robert Malley to reboot the atrocious but then-inert Iran Deal, had it not lifted oil export sanctions--resulting in a multibillion-dollar windfall to Tehran, had it not tried to ransom American hostages from Iran at $1.2 billion a captive, had it not restored hundreds of millions of dollars in support to the West Bank and Gaza, had it not allowed U.S. aid and remittance dollars to Lebanon to seep into Hezbollah coffers, had it not dropped past American  declarations that the Houthis were a terrorist organization, and had it not ignored rather than retaliated for dozens of attacks on US forces in Syria and Iraq by Iranian surrogates.

We should also take at his word one Ghazi Hamad.

He’s a high official in Hamas and one of their PR megaphones. And in an October 24 Lebanese television interview, Hamad  boasted: “We must teach Israel a lesson…and we will do this again and again. The Al Aqsa Flood [the October 7 attack] is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth…It is Israel, not us. We are the victims of the occupation…On Oct. 7, on Oct. 10, on October one-millionth, everything we do is justified…”

Hamad was quite clear on the motivation for his envisioned million more murder sprees: “The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears.”

So Hamad is promising more beheading, executions, rape, and mutilation. I don’t think Hamad—apparently waging endless jihad against Israeli civilians from a safe distance in Beirut—got the message about the much-heralded American “two-state solution” of mutual co-existence.

In other words, Hamad has no problem adhering to the Hamas-charter agenda of wiping out Israel: “Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nations, and must be finished.”

So is this final solution to Israel the “from the river to the sea” envisioned by our campus activists?

Ceux qui, dans les cabinets occultes ou les cabinets de conseil, pensent et élaborent les stratégies de communication. Car oui, avec Macron, on pense Communication only et pas intérêt des Français. Contrairement à ce qu’il se passe ici. Alors que faire pour enrayer cette perte de position ? Tout est permis et, comme au billard, des stratégies à plusieurs bandes. 

Souvenez-vous le 5 septembre 2023, le tribunal de Créteil refusait la requête d’une association qui voulait permettre au fondateur de WikiLeaks Julian Assange de demander l’asile « politique » en France, pays des supposées libertés. 

Cette décision très politique était d’ailleurs faite à Créteil, étrange, Valls n’est pas très loin et cela donnait certaines idées. Il ne faudrait pas que Valls, pour relancer sa carrière politique, ait joué des relations pour inciter la justice à se prononcer contre cette requête. Smiley clin d’œil. 

Mais les penseurs de Macron ont été plus rapides et lui ont suggéré, devant ses échecs à répétition en diplomatie, de jouer une dernière carte : sauver Assange pour sortir comme le héros. 

C’est une de ses dernières chances pour ne pas passer pour un censeur autocratique. Il est apparemment extrêmement jaloux d’@elonmusk comme Bernard Arnault qui, dans l’intimité, dit ne pas comprendre pourquoi il n’est pas aimé autant qu’Elon, étant aussi riche. 

@EmmanuelMacron lui a compris le coup à jouer. Il a envoyé Cédric Villani, en mauvaise position, aussi suite à la non-publication du rapport définitif sur les effets secondaires de la vaccination (on en reparlera). Donc Villani est mandaté en urgence pour faire le boulot pour lui. 

Comme il est tenu par le système, il n’avait pas le choix d’exécuter. Macron pense désormais être certain de se refaire une virginité en soutenant Assange. C’est sa dernière cartouche. 

Surtout avant le lâché de dossiers issus des tweeters files à la française et du carton de Donald Trump concernant le désormais célèbre détournement de mineurs, qui a eu lieu il y a plus de trente ans à Amiens.",2023-11-02T21:11:00.000Z,@zoesagan,True,"The repeated failures of @EmmanuelMacron in international diplomacy (failed visit to Putin, remember, he was at the end of a table, then the fact that the French are losing influence in Africa over 3 million km², without talking about the visit to Israel with changing and variable speeches) made the men in the shadows think.

Those who, in secret cabinets or consulting firms, think about and develop communication strategies. Because yes, with Macron, we think Communication only and not the interest of the French. Unlike what's happening here. So what can we do to stop this loss of position? Everything is allowed and, like billiards, strategies with several cushions.

Remember on September 5, 2023, the Créteil court refused the request of an association which wanted to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to request “political” asylum in France, the country of supposed freedoms.

This very political decision was also made in Créteil, strangely, Valls is not very far away and this gave certain ideas. Valls, in order to relaunch his political career, should not have used relationships to encourage the courts to rule against this request. Winking smiley.

But Macron's thinkers were quicker and suggested that, faced with his repeated failures in diplomacy, he play one last card: save Assange to emerge as the hero.

This is one of his last chances to avoid being seen as an autocratic censor. He is apparently extremely jealous of @elonmusk like Bernard Arnault who, privately, says he does not understand why he is not loved as much as Elon, being as rich.

@EmmanuelMacron understood the move to play. He sent Cédric Villani, in a bad position, also following the non-publication of the final report on the side effects of vaccination (we will talk about that again). So Villani is urgently mandated to do the job for him.

As he is bound by the system, he had no choice in executing. Macron now thinks he is sure to regain his virginity by supporting Assange. This is his last cartridge.

Especially before the release of files from the French tweeter files and Donald Trump's card concerning the now famous embezzlement of minors, which took place more than thirty years ago in Amiens."

Nous devons parler du jour d’après.

Nous allons distribuer des parcelles à tous ceux qui se sont battus pour Gaza, et aux expulsés de Gush Katif ».

Ce sont les propos du ministre israélien du Patrimoine, Amichai Eliyahu, dans un post Facebook d’hier le 02.11.23, accompagné d’une vidéo de char aplatissant des ruines de maisons bombardés.

Rappelons aussi que Gush Katif était un regroupement de colonies israéliennes au Sud de la bande de Gaza, qui s'étendait sur une douzaine de kilomètres, dont les villages s'étaient établis après la guerre des Six jours,
Le Gush Katif a été évacué en 2005 conformément au plan de désengagement de la bande de Gaza.

Quelqu’un a encore un doute sur l’intention réelle du gouvernement Netanyahou ?

Ils vident Gaza pour s’y installer.

C’était évident depuis le début.

These are the words of Israeli Minister of Heritage, Amichai Eliyahu, in a Facebook post yesterday on 02.11.23, accompanied by a video of a tank flattening the ruins of bombed houses.

Let us also recall that Gush Katif was a group of Israeli settlements in the south of the Gaza Strip, which extended over a dozen kilometers, whose villages were established after the Six-Day War,
Gush Katif was evacuated in 2005 in accordance with the disengagement plan from the Gaza Strip.

Does anyone still have any doubts about the real intention of the Netanyahu government?

They are emptying Gaza to settle there.

It was obvious from the start.

This is now said publicly.

- The discussions include a daytime calm for several hours

- Hamas has not yet agreed to the terms of the potential truce

- Includes bringing 50,000 liters of fuel per day into Gaza

🚨MY THOUGHTS:

This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Here's why:

- I posted 2 days ago a warning by Hezbollah and Iran to the U.S that if there is no truce, or at least plans for truce in the near future, Hezbollah will join the war

- Since then, we saw very serious escalations across Iranian proxies in the past few hours

- We've also seen the rhetoric from the 'Axis of Resistance' shift

- Since then, today I put out a statement telling people in Lebanon to leave immediately, and I thought it is more likely than not that Hezbollah and allies will declare war on Israel.

- However, now that we have reports of a possible truce (which doesn't entirely surprise me), my level of concern drops significantly and my stance goes back to what is was prior to 2 days ago: Hezbollah is unlikely to join the war.

1060,El Necio,1720040463392997805,1805,12,76,1096,Israel,"Cuba 🇨🇺 y Palestina 🇵🇸, dos pueblos hermanos bloqueados por EEUU e Israel

Cuba y Palestina son dos pueblos hermanos que son bloqueados por dos enemigos de la Paz y aliados entre sí, EEUU e Israel, que pretenden rendirlos por hambre para facilitar un golpe de Estado contra sus gobiernos, o directamente exterminarlos. 

A Cuba, EEUU le impone una guerra premeditada y sostenida en un tiempo de “paz” a través de un bloqueo económico de más de 60 años que mata lentamente al pueblo al privarle de las condiciones vitales de alimentación y salud, y que afecta a toda la sociedad en su conjunto; a Palestina, Israel la asesina a diario a través de un injusta e injustificada guerra y un bloqueo físico que también le impide acceder a sus necesidades más básicas; ambos bloqueos y agresiones se realizan con total impunidad a través del terrorismo de Estado que ocupa sus tierras, desplaza o desaparece a sus habitantes y a sus poblados, ataca militarmente y trata de impedir su supervivencia como nación.

Ante tanta agresión, las víctimas no sólo resisten y se defienden, si no que se solidarizan entre sí: la diplomacia cubana, basada en firmes principios de solidaridad y de respeto a la soberanía de los pueblos, siempre ha defendido a Palestina ante la agresión de Israel, sin importar el coste político; son muchos los maestros y médicos palestinos formados en Cuba que hoy resisten o mueren bajo las bombas de Israel, compradas a EEUU y a alguna que otra potencia occidental, como la española. 

Palestina siempre ha estado al lado de Cuba en la lucha contra el bloqueo y es aliada en la construcción de un mundo que cuente con los países empobrecidos del Sur. 

Históricamente, los líderes Yasir Arafat y Fidel Castro han estado hermanados en múltiples batallas diplomáticas, y sus discursos aún son recordados y estudiados al poseer una vigencia tan fuerte que sonroja a las potencias occidentales.

Pero los verdugos también se solidarizan en su política guerrerista. 

Cuba recibe cada año en la ONU el apoyo casi unánime de la comunidad internacional para exigir a EEUU que levante el bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero. Solo votan en contra EEUU e Israel. 

En su genocidio planificado, EEUU actúa como hermano mayor y protector de Israel en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, le da cobertura militar, política y económica.

 Además, el lobby sionista en EEUU es tan poderoso que condiciona la política interna del país norteamericano, como lo hace la mafia cubanoamericana de Miami, difuminando quién es rehén de quién, o incluso mostrando una complicidad perversa.

Por otro lado, Cuba y Palestina también reciben la solidaridad mundial frente a la barbarie de EEUU e Israel. 

Son numerosas las acciones que cada año organizan las organizaciones de solidaridad con Cuba y con Palestina, a pesar de ser estigmatizadas o silenciadas por la prensa corporativa. No es la primera vez que asociaciones de apoyo al pueblo palestino son señaladas por el Estado de Israel como terroristas, como lo es Cuba, incluida en una perversa y espuria lista que confecciona EEUU de países patrocinadores de esta lacra. Tremenda hipocresía la de estos gobiernos que sí patrocinan y financian el terrorismo, como lo sufrió Cuba desde el triunfo de la revolución en 1959, con 3478 víctimas mortales y con 2099 personas heridas, y como lo sufre Palestina en la actualidad, en la penúltima intervención militar sionista, que suma varios miles de asesinados, la mayoría civiles menores.

En honor a la Humanidad, por el derecho a vivir en paz, por Cuba, por Palestina, por los pueblos que sufren bloqueos ilegales e inhumanos aplicados por verdugos criminales de guerra que cometen delitos de lesa humanidad, éstos deben ser juzgados y condenados por la Justicia Internacional.",2023-11-02T11:29:00.000Z,@ElNecio_Cuba,True,"Cuba 🇨🇺 and Palestine 🇵🇸, two brother peoples blocked by the US and Israel

Cuba and Palestine are two brother peoples that are blocked by two enemies of Peace and allies of each other, the US and Israel, who intend to starve them into submission to facilitate a coup against their governments, or directly exterminate them.

On Cuba, the United States imposes a premeditated and sustained war in a time of “peace” through an economic blockade of more than 60 years that slowly kills the people by depriving them of the vital conditions of food and health, and that affects the entire society as a whole; Israel murders Palestine daily through an unjust and unjustified war and a physical blockade that also prevents it from accessing its most basic needs; Both blockades and attacks are carried out with total impunity through State terrorism that occupies their lands, displaces or disappears their inhabitants and their towns, attacks militarily and tries to prevent their survival as a nation.

In the face of so much aggression, the victims not only resist and defend themselves, but also show solidarity with each other: Cuban diplomacy, based on firm principles of solidarity and respect for the sovereignty of the people, has always defended Palestine against the aggression of Israel, regardless of the political cost; There are many Palestinian teachers and doctors trained in Cuba who today resist or die under the bombs of Israel, bought from the US and some other Western power, such as Spain.

Palestine has always been at Cuba's side in the fight against the blockade and is an ally in building a world that includes the impoverished countries of the South.

Historically, leaders Yasir Arafat and Fidel Castro have been twinned in multiple diplomatic battles, and their speeches are still remembered and studied as they have such a strong validity that it makes Western powers blush.

But the executioners also show solidarity in their warlike policy.

Every year at the UN, Cuba receives almost unanimous support from the international community to demand that the United States lift the economic, commercial and financial blockade. Only the US and Israel vote against.

In its planned genocide, the US acts as Israel's older brother and protector in the UN Security Council, giving it military, political and economic cover.

 Furthermore, the Zionist lobby in the US is so powerful that it conditions the internal politics of the North American country, as does the Cuban-American mafia in Miami, blurring who is hostage to whom, or even showing perverse complicity.

On the other hand, Cuba and Palestine also receive global solidarity in the face of the barbarity of the US and Israel.

There are numerous actions organized each year by solidarity organizations with Cuba and Palestine, despite being stigmatized or silenced by the corporate press. This is not the first time that associations supporting the Palestinian people are designated by the State of Israel as terrorists, such as Cuba, included in a perverse and spurious list drawn up by the US of countries that sponsor this scourge. Tremendous hypocrisy of these governments that do sponsor and finance terrorism, as Cuba suffered since the triumph of the revolution in 1959, with 3,478 fatalities and 2,099 people injured, and as Palestine suffers today, in the penultimate intervention. Zionist military, which totals several thousand murdered, most of them minor civilians.

In honor of Humanity, for the right to live in peace, for Cuba, for Palestine, for the peoples who suffer illegal and inhuman blockades applied by war criminal executioners who commit crimes against humanity, these must be tried and condemned by the International Justice."

Each carries a unique life story, and loving families eagerly await their return. Today, in #Shibuya, #Tokyo, a peaceful assembly was held by Israeli, Jewish, and Japanese supporters to advocate for their immediate and safe return to their families. 

We think of each and every one of you, and we will do everything possible to bring you back home.

Dia guna kuasa media sosial tunjuk keadaan sebenar kat Gaza. Last dia update Instagram tiga hari lepas. Tapi tadi New York Times ada lapor pasal dia.

Dia dok ada kat selatan Gaza tengah berteduh kat sebuah tadika... tak jauh dari sempadan Rafah. Dan dia ada pesanan untuk dunia.

“Kualiti hidup teruk sangat. Kena bergaduh nak dapat beberapa liter air. Bila cakap tiada air, saya mohon orang ramai faham kami dah berhari-hari tak minum air walau setitis pun.”

Our nightmare. Their reality.

“Kebersihan [hygiene] dah jadi kemewahan sekarang. Tak ada air nak basuh tangan. Tak ada air nak gosok gigi.”

“Saya tersiksa sangat sebab beberapa hari lalu...... saya terkena keracunan makanan.”

Seorang wanita. Situasi macam ni. Tiada air.

“Kalau bom tak bunuh kami, situasi kami pasti bunuh kami nanti. Jadi saya bertahan selama mungkin sebab nak teman mak saya. Cuma saya tak tahu apa akan jadi.”

Nour AlSaqqa bagitau dia takut kalau krisis ni berterusan, dia akan meninggal dunia.

1121,Azzam Mujahid Izzulhaq,1720292693262410098,1111,15,46,661,Palestine,"Pada 21 Agustus 1969, Masjid Al
Aqsha dibakar. Api dengan segera melahap sajadah, mushaf Al Quran, atap masjid dan beberapa bagian-bagian masjid yg terbuat dari kayu. Salah satu yg turut terbakar adalah mimbar yg dibuat pada tahun 1187 dan diletakkan di Al Aqsha oleh pemimpin dan pahlawan umat Islam Shalahuddin Al Ayyubi, sang pembebas dan pembuka Al Quds pada tahun yg sama setelah mengalahkam tentara salib yg dipimpin oleh Richard I (The Lionheart) dari Inggris setelah berkuasa hampir 1 abad di sana.

Pelaku pembakarannya adalah seseorang yg berasal dari Australia bernama Dennis Michael Rohan yg didukung penuh oleh pemukim pendatang Zionis Israel lainnya di sana. Umat Islam setempat berusaha memadamkan api tersebut. Namun, upaya tersebut dihalangi oleh tentara Zionis Israel.

Dennis Michael Rohan ditangkap dua hari kemudian pada tanggal 23 Agustus 1969. Namun dibebaskan atas alasan gangguan jiwa.

Hal yg lebih ‘menarik’ adalah pernyataan Perdana Menteri Israel Golda Meir (PM perempuan satu-satunya) pada saat terjadinya kebakaran di Masjid Al Aqsha tersebut. Ia mengaku tidak bisa tidur karena takut negara-negara Arab sekitar dan dunia Islam menyerang Israel sebagai bentuk perlawanan atas terbakarnya Masjid Al Aqsha dan juga kekalahan perang Enam Hari pada tahun 1967, dua tahun sebelumnya. Namun, besoknya ternyata tidak terjadi apa-apa.

Muncullah pernyataan Golda Meir yg diabadikan dalam catatan sejarah yg seharusnya menjadi tamparan keras negara-negara Arab dan dunia Islam:

“Aku tak bisa tidur di hari ketika Al Aqsha terbakar. Dan aku mengira hari itu Israel akan musnah. Namun ketika aku menjumpai pagi, ternyata malah Arab dan Islam-lah yg sedang tertidur”.

Hari ini, 54 tahun setelah terbakarnya Masjid Al Aqsha dan pernyataan Golda Meir, apakah Arab dan dunia Islam masih tertidur? Semoga saja tidak.",2023-11-03T04:11:00.000Z,@AzzamIzzulhaq,True,"On August 21, 1969, the Al Mosque
Aqsa was burned. The fire immediately consumed prayer mats, Al-Quran manuscripts, the roof of the mosque and several wooden parts of the mosque. One of the things that also burned was the pulpit which was made in 1187 and placed in Al Aqsa by the leader and hero of the Muslim community, Salahuddin Al Ayyubi, the liberator and opener of Al Quds in the same year after defeating the crusaders led by Richard I (The Lionheart). from England after ruling there for almost a century.

The perpetrator of the arson was someone from Australia named Dennis Michael Rohan who was fully supported by other Israeli Zionist settlers there. Local Muslims tried to extinguish the fire. However, this effort was blocked by the Israeli Zionist army.

Dennis Michael Rohan was arrested two days later on August 23, 1969. However, he was released on the grounds of mental disorder.

What is more 'interesting' is the statement by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (the only female PM) at the time of the fire at the Al Aqsa Mosque. He admitted that he could not sleep because he was afraid that surrounding Arab countries and the Islamic world would attack Israel as a form of resistance to the burning of the Al Aqsa Mosque and also the defeat of the Six Day War in 1967, two years earlier. However, the next day nothing happened.

Golda Meir's statement emerged which was immortalized in historical records which should have been a harsh slap to the Arab countries and the Islamic world:

“I couldn't sleep the day Al Aqsa burned down. And I thought that day Israel would be destroyed. But when I met the morning, it turned out that it was the Arabs and Muslims who were asleep.""

Today, 54 years after the burning of the Al Aqsa Mosque and Golda Meir's statement, is the Arab and Islamic world still asleep? I hope not."

Le Washington Post a interrogé des médecins et des experts et a conclu que Tsahal tue des milliers d’enfants palestiniens à Gaza. Les journalistes ont déclaré que grâce à l’armée israélienne, la région est devenue comme un « cimetière pour enfants ».

🤯 Le journal note que selon les seules données officielles du ministère de la Santé de la bande de Gaza, plus de 3,7 mille enfants sont morts depuis le début du conflit, et selon Save the Children, deux décès de civils sur cinq à Gaza sont dus à enfants.

 💬 « Nous sommes désormais dans une situation où un enfant est tué toutes les 10 minutes. Gaza devient un cimetière pour enfants. Pour tout le monde, c’est un véritable enfer », ont déclaré les interlocuteurs de WP.

Étonnamment, moins d’un mois s’est écoulé avant que les journalistes américains n’attirent enfin l’attention sur les crimes de guerre commis par Tsahal. Alors que Biden traîne assidûment sa propre réputation dans la boue en soutenant sans réserve le bombardement de Gaza, la communauté mondiale – même celle qui n’était pas initialement en faveur de la Palestine – est maintenant lentement en ébullition.

The Washington Post interviewed doctors and experts and concluded that the IDF is killing thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza. Journalists said that thanks to the Israeli army, the area has become like a “children’s cemetery.”

🤯 The newspaper notes that according to official data from the Ministry of Health of the Gaza Strip alone, more than 3.7 thousand children have died since the start of the conflict, and according to Save the Children, two out of five civilian deaths in Gaza are due to children.

 💬 “We are now in a situation where a child is killed every 10 minutes. Gaza becomes a children's cemetery. For everyone, it’s real hell,” said the WP interlocutors.

Surprisingly, less than a month passed before American journalists finally called attention to the IDF's war crimes. As Biden assiduously drags his own reputation through the mud by wholeheartedly supporting the bombing of Gaza, the global community – even one that was not initially in favor of Palestine – is now slowly boiling over.

🚨 The result could be a social explosion, which would mark the start of a fierce confrontation between the Muslim world and the Western world. And one suspects that the West will inevitably lose in this battle."

1149,Natalie Smolenski,1719792338791231559,666,9,54,217,Palestine,"I visited Israel/Palestine in 2008. Tel Aviv, West Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, Galilee, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the West Bank city Qalqilya. The country is breathtakingly beautiful, of immeasurable historic value. There are so many amazing people, on all “sides” of this conflict, living on this tiny strip of land. But the visit left me genuinely traumatized. There was no doubt that there had been a war going on for generations, which had hardened into a system of occupation and oppression.

I was in East Jerusalem (which was then “Palestinian” territory) on Israel’s Independence Day. I watched packs of young IDF soldiers parade through the streets, automatic weapons out, fingers on triggers, singing nationalist songs. Palestinian shopkeepers shuttered their shops in fear of being killed or robbed (soldiers were known to just bulldoze through stores, taking whatever they wanted). Many Palestinian shopkeepers had pictures in their shops of relatives, including children, who had been killed in the conflict. The marching IDF soldiers were accompanied by plain-clothes Israelis also carrying automatic weapons, also fingers on triggers. You couldn’t tell if these people were cops, undercover military, or just ordinary people. There was a sense that violence could erupt at any moment. This set the tone for the rest of the trip.

I saw that Palestinian life was mired by a network of checkpoints and ID requirements that in effect ground social and economic life to a halt. If you were a Palestinian living in the West Bank, you needed a Jerusalem ID card to go to that city, which was probably only 30 minutes or an hour away from where you lived. If you were Palestinian and out of the country for more than 45 days, the Israeli government could simply revoke your Palestinian ID card, meaning you couldn’t get back in your own country (and you weren’t a citizen of Israel anyway). For this reason, many Palestinians were afraid to travel. Palestinian students couldn’t attend Israeli Universities. About 20% of Palestinians and 40% of Palestinian men had been in prison, and almost all of those imprisoned (90-95%) had been tortured. 

Palestinians had to wait in hours-long lines to pass through checkpoints to go to work or to the hospital. They could be turned away for any reason, which meant they would not be able to work or get medical treatment that day. Pregnant women were often forced to give birth in cars or on the road because they couldn’t get through checkpoints in time. People regularly died waiting in checkpoints. The road system was also segregated: some roads were for Jewish people only. Unless they were settlers in specific communities, most Jewish Israelis were not allowed to go to the West Bank or Gaza to see the effects of the occupation themselves. The “separation fence,” ostensibly meant to separate Israel from the Palestinian Territories, also cut many Palestinian towns in half, forcing families and neighbors to go through an arduous checkpoint process just to see one another. In the West Bank city of Qalqilya, my friends and I saw an above-ground sewer that had had bars placed on the openings, so that people couldn’t even use the sewers to quickly get to hospital, which was in a different city. 

In the Palestinian village of Nazareth, where Jesus is believed to have grown up, my friends and I visited beautiful churches. We spoke with many ordinary Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian. I bought a bottle of the olive oil made in the town—it tasted exquisite. “You have to help us,” said the woman selling me the olive oil, pleading with her eyes.

1175,Caitlin Johnstone,1720263460074950866,1381,21,54,452,Gaza,"Biden ‘Countering Islamophobia’ While Incinerating Gaza Is The Most Democrat Thing Ever

In what is arguably the most liberal thing ever to have happened in all of human history, the Biden administration has announced its plans to develop a US National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia even as it helps Israel massacre Muslims by the thousands in Gaza.

“For too long, Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents,” reads a White House statement on the announcement. “We all mourn the recent barbaric killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy, and the brutal attack on his mother in their home outside Chicago.”

This comes as the death toll from the US-backed bombing campaign in Gaza nears 10,000, including 3,760 children, in what experts and authorities around the world are describing with increasing frequency as a genocide. If these people were Jewish instead of Muslim, they would not be trapped in a giant concentration camp while the IDF hammers them with a nonstop barrage of military explosives, but because of their ethnicity they are subjected to this horror.

There’s a classic meme which makes fun of the way US foreign policy under Democrats is the same murderous foreign policy as it is under Republicans, but with a bunch of woke-sounding bumper stickers slapped on the surface to make it palatable for progressive sensibilities:

Can you think of a better illustration of the dynamic that’s highlighted by this criticism than what we’re seeing from the Biden administration today? This is after all the same administration whose Department of Defense recently said they are putting zero limits on what Israel may or may not do with the weapons it’s being given by the United States.

“We are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that is provided,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told the press on Monday. “That is really up to the Israel Defense Force to use in how they are going to conduct their operations. But we’re not putting any constraints on that.”

As In These Times reports, this same administration is also trying to get permission to conduct arms deals with Israel without congressional supervision, in complete secrecy and without accountability to the voting public.

The US government is every bit as culpable in the massacre of thousands of Muslim children as Israel, because this entire massacre is happening with both its assistance and its express permission. But here is its government pretending to care deeply that one Muslim child was killed by an Islamophobic psycho in America.

This is everything that’s disgusting about the Democratic Party. It puts a warm, friendly face on the most murderous and tyrannical power structure on earth, posing as a defender of marginalized groups while dropping bombs on the most marginalized populations on this planet. It selects a high number of women and racially diverse officials for its cabinet positions to convey the illusion that it has transcended the abusive bigotries of the past, while subjecting impoverished brown-skinned foreigners to a nonstop barrage of high-tech explosive munitions in massacres that would be the envy of the worst white supremacist imperialists in history.

A much more accurate image for the United States than the one it tries to give itself with its fraudulent progressive virtue signalling would be the one it was given by protesters who interrupted Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday. Demonstrators painted their hands red to show the blood this administration has on its own hands, resulting in viral images of Blinken’s face surrounded by bloody hands circulating all over the internet.

That’s what the US empire really is. Not the liberal bastion of human rights it presents itself as, but a blood-spattered psychopathic murder machine which maintains its domination of this planet with the nonstop butchery of human beings.

The longer the massacre in Gaza goes on, the more people are catching a glimpse behind the plastic smiley-faced mask of the US empire and seeing the cold-eyed killer underneath.",2023-11-03T02:15:00.000Z,@caitoz,True,"Biden ‘Countering Islamophobia’ While Incinerating Gaza Is The Most Democrat Thing Ever

In what is arguably the most liberal thing ever to have happened in all of human history, the Biden administration has announced its plans to develop a US National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia even as it helps Israel massacre Muslims by the thousands in Gaza.

“For too long, Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents,” reads a White House statement on the announcement. “We all mourn the recent barbaric killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy, and the brutal attack on his mother in their home outside Chicago.”

This comes as the death toll from the US-backed bombing campaign in Gaza nears 10,000, including 3,760 children, in what experts and authorities around the world are describing with increasing frequency as a genocide. If these people were Jewish instead of Muslim, they would not be trapped in a giant concentration camp while the IDF hammers them with a nonstop barrage of military explosives, but because of their ethnicity they are subjected to this horror.

There’s a classic meme which makes fun of the way US foreign policy under Democrats is the same murderous foreign policy as it is under Republicans, but with a bunch of woke-sounding bumper stickers slapped on the surface to make it palatable for progressive sensibilities:

Can you think of a better illustration of the dynamic that’s highlighted by this criticism than what we’re seeing from the Biden administration today? This is after all the same administration whose Department of Defense recently said they are putting zero limits on what Israel may or may not do with the weapons it’s being given by the United States.

“We are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that is provided,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told the press on Monday. “That is really up to the Israel Defense Force to use in how they are going to conduct their operations. But we’re not putting any constraints on that.”

As In These Times reports, this same administration is also trying to get permission to conduct arms deals with Israel without congressional supervision, in complete secrecy and without accountability to the voting public.

The US government is every bit as culpable in the massacre of thousands of Muslim children as Israel, because this entire massacre is happening with both its assistance and its express permission. But here is its government pretending to care deeply that one Muslim child was killed by an Islamophobic psycho in America.

This is everything that’s disgusting about the Democratic Party. It puts a warm, friendly face on the most murderous and tyrannical power structure on earth, posing as a defender of marginalized groups while dropping bombs on the most marginalized populations on this planet. It selects a high number of women and racially diverse officials for its cabinet positions to convey the illusion that it has transcended the abusive bigotries of the past, while subjecting impoverished brown-skinned foreigners to a nonstop barrage of high-tech explosive munitions in massacres that would be the envy of the worst white supremacist imperialists in history.

Vous pouvez toutes les retrouver et les enregistrer sur cette chaîne en remontant ou dans l’onglet média.

Since the #Hamas massacres are denied or relativized by some, videos of their crimes must be circulated.

I have published almost all the public videos on this channel (except 2/3 which are really too atrocious and those from this evening which I had not yet broadcast).

You can find them all and save them on this channel by going up or in the media tab.

Obviously difficult videos can only be broadcast by warning the public and not on any medium.

All the videos are being put online on hamas-massacre.net/ or t.me/hamasdid

He said Israeli military commanders had ordered the “shelling [of] houses on their occupants in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the [Israeli] hostages”.

Nor did Williamson refer to the testimony of Yasmin Porat, who sought shelter in Be’eri from the nearby Nova music festival. Porat told Israeli Radio that once Israeli special forces arrived: “They eliminated everyone, including the [Israeli] hostages because there was very, very heavy crossfire.”

Are the images of charred bodies presented by the BBC, accompanied by a warning of their graphic, upsetting nature, incontrovertible proof that Hamas behaved like monsters, bent on the most twisted kind of vengeance?

Gençler inisiyatif alıyor, boykot, eylem, bildiri ne gerekiyorsa yapıyor. Bizimki sızlanıyor: ""Bu işler gereksiz."" 

Anadolu Ajansı kelle koltukta günde 30 tane Siyonist terör örgütü yalanı çürütüyor. Beriki laf atıyor: ""Nolmuş ki yani?"" 

Hani bu gece Tel Aviv'e füze atsak bu gevşek mabadlılar diyecek ki ""sanki bana atom bombası."" 

Bütün bunları bir noktaya kadar anlarım da ""bizim"" dediğimiz insanlar, edilen dualara da kulp takıp ""dua ile olmaz"" diyorlar ya, işte orada deli oluyorum. 

Duadan başkasıyla olmaz efendi! Duan yoksa hiçsin, yoksun, hükümsüzsün. 

Zihni Müslüman olmayanın kazanacağı bir savaş yok bize. Rabbimiz, bir mazlumun, bir sabinin, bir canı yanmışın duasına icabet edebilir her an. O dua ile Siyonistin gözleri görmez, elleri tutmaz, kulakları duymaz olabilir.

You know, if we fire a missile at Tel Aviv tonight, these lax Mabad people will say, ""It's like an atomic bomb to me.""

I understand all of this up to a point, but when the people we call ""our"" dismiss the prayers and say ""it can't be done with prayers"", that's where I go crazy.

It can't be done with anything other than prayer, sir! If you don't have prayer, you are nothing, you are void, you are null and void.

There is no war for us that can be won by those whose minds are not Muslim. Our Lord can answer the prayer of an oppressed, a patient, or a hurt person at any time. With that prayer, the Zionist's eyes may not be able to see, his hands may not be able to hold, and his ears may not be able to hear.

There is no war that those who do not believe in this can win.

We will try. We will continue to throw stones at the enemy. The stone was small, but it was big, what a shame. Ant, Hz. He carried water in his mouth to extinguish the fire prepared to burn Abraham.

If you're not an ant, let's not talk. Especially if you are a fool who says ""this cannot be done with an ant"", let's not talk about it at all. It only happens with ants."

Ce docteur 🇵🇸 a fait le choix de prendre la parole en anglais (langue universelle) parce qu'il veut que le monde 🌍l’écoute et pas juste les arabes ou les Pays Musulmans, c’est un appel à supporter Gaza. 

Écoutez-le, s'il vous plaît, écoutez les voix palestiniennes.

Ça m’a brisé de voir les deux enfants en arrière plan (qu’ الله azzawajal apaise les maux des victimes) , et de savoir qu’ils manquent de ravitaillement.. Qu’ الله azzawajal assure leurs subsistances, آمين !

Je vous demande une chose par pure bonté humaine : ne choisissez pas d'ignorer tout cela, honorez sa prise de parole faite au monde entier et agissez en étant leurs voix, en dénonçant, en faisant du bruit et en priant pour la délivrance et un cessez-le-feu.

It broke me to see the two children in the background (may الله azzawajal soothe the victims' ills), and to know that they lack supplies.. May الله azzawajal ensure their sustenance, آمين!

 He added that, according to UNICEF, more than 420 children are killed or injured every day in the Gaza Strip.  The senator then asked Austin whether the US should ensure that American support is used in accordance with the laws of war and US law.
 Austin promised that Washington would point out to allies “the need to take into account civilian populations in combat zones.”
 When Van Hollen tried to ask another question, his microphone was turned off, justifying this with restrictions on the time of communication with the head of the Pentagon.

Ini judul kolom di Harian Al Arab, punya Uni Emirat.

Kolom ini menjelaskan kenapa organ2 seperti Hamas dan jaringan Ikhwan Muslimin jadi musuh bersama negara2 Arab. 

Mengapa Hamas di Palestina, Ikhwan di Mesir, Hizbullah di Lebanon, dan Houthi Yaman, jadi duri dalam daging negara2 Arab. 

Karena agenda sektarian (khilafah) mereka mengancam negara bangsa. 

Presiden Mesir Anwar Sadat tewas di tangan tentara pro Ikhwan. Hizbullah menghancurkan Lebanon sebagai negara bangsa. Demikian juga Houthi di Yaman. Dan Hamas di Gaza.

Kelompok2 ini berkepentingan terus mengobarkan perang agama. Tujuannya menyeret negara2 kawasan ke dalam konflik berkepanjangan. Merontokkan batas2 negara bangsa. 

Membaca opini seperti ini penting bagi kita. Biar gak gumunan. Gak gampang marah dg yang terjadi di Timur Tengah.

This is the title of a column in Al Arab Daily, owned by the United Emirates.

This column explains why organs such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood network are common enemies of Arab countries.

Why are Hamas in Palestine, the Brotherhood in Egypt, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen, becoming thorns in the flesh of Arab countries.

Because their sectarian agenda (caliphate) threatens the nation state.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was killed by pro-Brotherhood soldiers. Hezbollah destroyed Lebanon as a nation state. Likewise the Houthis in Yemen. And Hamas in Gaza.

These groups have an interest in continuing to wage religious war. The aim is to drag regional countries into prolonged conflict. Tear down the boundaries of nation states.

Reading opinions like this is important for us. So it doesn't get messy. It's not easy to get angry about what's happening in the Middle East.

Hindu: But Hamas started it. They paraded Israeli/ German women n@ked, butchered/ burned alive little children.

MF: That's resistance. When someone occupies your land, you are free to throw them out by all means.

H: Who occupied what?

MF: Jews occupied Israel - the land of Muslims - Palestine.

H: But Israel is land of Jews.

MF: Haha fake news. There was nothing known as Israel before 1948. US & west conspired against Muslims and occupied our land.

H: But Allah Herself calls Jews as ""children of Israel"" at least 40 times in Quran. If Israel didn't exist before 1948, was Quran written in 1949? Or is Quran wrong?

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: Still, Jews are occupiers of Muslim land of Palestine.

H: But there's no mention of word/ place called Palestine in Allah's book. So it's Muslims who must explain what they did to original Israel & its children mentioned in Quran that they were out of their land for 1400 yrs. If one party that's occupier here, it's Muslims, not the Jews.

MF:

H: Why silent?

In holy book and Hadith, isn't it written that before Islamic judgement day, Muslims will k!ll all Jews and even stones & trees will help Muslims in the genocide? Even if Israel does nothing, their slaughter is certain?

MF: No Jew/ Hindu/ non-Muslim can get Jannat. Yes, k!lling of Jews before Qayamat is mentioned in our books. So what? That's Allah's word. But why are Jews k!lling innocent Muslims now?

H: So Jews should wait for the day when they get slaughtered by zombies and till then they must embrace you as brothers? And even after getting slaughtered, they'll be burned in eternal Islamic hell. Why shouldn't Jews defend themselves and preempt future slaughter today?

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: You're a typical Hindutva genocide enabler.

H: And who are you?

2437,Leandro Ruschel 🇧🇷🇺🇸🇮🇹🇩🇪,1720079085991243928,5583,45,90,1644,Hamas,"Pela primeira vez, desde que a guerra em Israel foi iniciada por um ataque terrorista covarde do Hamas, vejo evidência de um palestino apontando o dedo para quem de fato é responsável por tudo isso.

""A culpa é dos cães do Hamas"", disse uma senhora palestina, em sofrimento diante de pessoas mortas sob os escombros. Rapidamente, ela teve a boca tapada pela mão de uma pessoa ao seu lado, talvez por discordância com o que ela falou, talvez temendo a retaliação que ela sofreria dos terroristas.

A verdade é essa: os terroristas usam a população de Gaza como bucha de canhão. Instalam suas bases em áreas densamente povoadas, para evitar ataques israelenses, e para poder culpar Israel pela morte de civis.

Além disso, suprimentos enviados aos civis são desviados para suas operações terroristas. Um integrante do grupo afirmou que eles têm combustível, água e alimento armazenados para 4 meses. Eles tem roubado gasolina e comida enviados para hospitais e campos de refugiados. Chegaram ao ponto de destruir um novo sistema de encanamento de água para produzir foguetes com os canos.

Na semana passada, um líder do Hamas respondeu a um jornalista árabe, que perguntou por que o grupo não abria seus túneis à população se proteger contra bombardeios, dizendo que os túneis eram de uso exclusivo dos terroristas.

Quando Israel ordenou a evacuação do setor norte de Gaza, milícias do Hamas dinamitaram estradas e chegaram a atirar em civis que buscavam sair do local, exigindo que eles ficassem, expondo as pessoas aos bombardeios.

O Hamas instalou em Gaza uma ditadura obscurantista, que segue a Sharia, a lei islâmica que prevê a pena de morte a homossexuais, e o tratamento de mulheres como cidadãs de segunda classe, para ficar apenas em dois exemplos. Não há liberdade de expressão, não há representação popular, não há imprensa livre. A oposição é tratada a tiros.

Quem defende o Hamas, está defendo não só o terrorismo, mas o pior tipo de totalitarismo, contra a única democracia existente no Oriente Médio.",2023-11-02T14:03:00.000Z,@leandroruschel,True,"For the first time since the war in Israel was started by a cowardly terrorist attack by Hamas, I see evidence of a Palestinian pointing the finger at who is actually responsible for all this.

""It's the Hamas dogs' fault,"" said a Palestinian woman, in pain as people died under the rubble. She quickly had her mouth covered by the hand of a person next to her, perhaps out of disagreement with what she said, perhaps fearing the retaliation she would suffer from the terrorists.

The truth is this: terrorists use the population of Gaza as cannon fodder. They install their bases in densely populated areas, to avoid Israeli attacks, and to be able to blame Israel for the deaths of civilians.

Additionally, supplies sent to civilians are diverted to their terrorist operations. A member of the group stated that they have fuel, water and food stored for 4 months. They have stolen gasoline and food sent to hospitals and refugee camps. They even went so far as to destroy a new water piping system to make rockets from the pipes.

Last week, a Hamas leader responded to an Arab journalist who asked why the group did not open its tunnels to the population to protect themselves against bombings, saying that the tunnels were for the exclusive use of terrorists.

When Israel ordered the evacuation of the northern sector of Gaza, Hamas militias dynamited roads and even shot at civilians who tried to leave the area, demanding that they stay, exposing people to shelling.

Hamas has installed an obscurantist dictatorship in Gaza, which follows Sharia, the Islamic law that provides for the death penalty for homosexuals, and the treatment of women as second-class citizens, to name just two examples. There is no freedom of expression, there is no popular representation, there is no free press. The opposition is shot at.

Whoever defends Hamas is defending not only terrorism, but the worst type of totalitarianism, against the only democracy in the Middle East."

Tüneller için özel bir birim kurduk. Sistemi kontrol eden ve bütün dolaşımı, lojistiği ve güvenliği sağlayan özel bir birim bulunuyor.

en büyük hedefi bu ağa dair bilgiedinmek. Ama yeraltı bağlantı ağını çözme şansları sıfır

İSRAİL BÜYÜK BİR SALDIRI PLANLIYORDU 

Bu operasyonun görünmeyen kısmında çok ciddi bir hazırlık vardı. İsrail bu yenilgiyi hiçbir biçimde unutamaz. 

Elbette İsrail vahşeti ile ilgili hesaplar yaptık. Ancak dünya bilsin ki İsrail bu bayramlarının hemen ertesinde Gazze’ye büyük bir saldırı yapacaktı. Tuzağa düştüler. Şimdi bir yandan Gazze’yi bombalıyor, diğer yandan kendi içlerinde kavga ediyorlar.

Oyunu tamamen kendimiz kurduk. Hatta Mossad’a Gazze’deki durumla ilgili yanıltıcı mesajların ulaşmasını sağladık. İsrail istihbaratı ve ordusunu uyuttuk. O gece Yahudi Simhat Tora bayramıydı. Kutlamalar öncesi İç İstihbarat Birimi (Şabak) ve Mossad bir rapor hazırladı. Tel Aviv’e,Gazze’de ve sınırda konuşlu tümenin güvenliğinin hiç olmadığı kadar sağlam olduğu bildirildi.

Bu rapor sebebiyle ordu mensupları gece boyu içki içip sefahate daldı. Biz de onları o gafi l yakaladık. 1.200 genç, 12 bin kişilik siyonist tümeni dağıttı. Her açıdan onları kör ettik. Bütün elektronik sistemlerini felce uğrattık. Hacker’larımız sistemlerini çökertti.

Onlara tarihî hezimet yaşattık.

O gün ve sonrasında sadece askerlerle savaştık. Sivillere kıymadık. Maalesef 1948’den sadece İsrail’le değil, onların uşaklarıyla savaşıyoruz.

""We will not betray the trust of Sultan Abdulhamid""

Hamas official Talal en-Nassar stated that Israel's biggest fear is the tunnels and said, “Every network has an alternative. The chances of unraveling Israel's underground network are zero.

We established a special unit for tunnels. There is a special unit that controls the system and ensures all circulation, logistics and security.

Every network has an alternative. of Israel
The biggest goal is to gain information about this network. But they have zero chance of deciphering the underground network.

ISRAEL WAS PLANNING A MAJOR ATTACK

There was very serious preparation in the invisible part of this operation. Israel can never forget this defeat.

Of course, we made calculations about Israeli brutality. However, the world should know that Israel would launch a major attack on Gaza right after these holidays. They fell into the trap. Now, on the one hand, they are bombing Gaza, and on the other hand, they are fighting among themselves.

We created the game entirely ourselves. We even ensured that misleading messages about the situation in Gaza reached Mossad. We put the Israeli intelligence and army to sleep. That night was the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. Before the celebrations, the Internal Intelligence Unit (Şabak) and Mossad prepared a report. It was reported that the security of the division stationed in Tel Aviv, Gaza and the border is stronger than ever.

Because of this report, the army members drank and indulged in debauchery all night long. We caught them off guard. 1,200 young people dispersed the 12 thousand-strong Zionist division. We blindsided them from every angle. We paralyzed all their electronic systems. Our hackers crashed their systems.

We inflicted a historical defeat on them.

That day and afterwards we fought only with soldiers. We did not kill civilians. Unfortunately, since 1948, we have been fighting not only with Israel, but also with their lackeys.

Unfortunately, we could not see Erdoğan's stance in the Islamic world and Arab countries, with a few exceptions. Even if they kill every single one of us, we will not give up on the Palestinian cause. We will not betray the trust of Sultan Abdulhamid..

Zira Ebu Ubeyde'nin müjdeleri hiçbirimize yetmiyor. Çok istiyoruz ama gözümüzle görmeden inanamıyoruz.
Çünkü bizim gibi hayatı bu meselelerin merkezinde geçmiş kimseler için bile, yenilmez, yıkılmaz, yok olmaz bir İsrail efsanesi yaratıldı. Biz dahi çağımızın bu en büyük yalanına kurban olduk. İşte Hamas'ın arslanları, en çok da bizi bu esaretten kurtarıyor.
Yazdıkları destanların yanında, onlara ne büyük bir minnet borçluyuz bir düşünün.
Oysa Rabbimiz Kitabullahında zaten müjdelemişti; ""yeryüzünde sizden en çok nefret eden, dünyayı en çok seven ve ölümden en çok korkanlar olarak Yahudileri bulacaksın.""
Anlayacağınız Hamas'a sadece izzet ve şerefimizi değil, binbir bedel ödeyerek yeniden hatırlattıkları imanımızı, inancımızı, itikadımızı ve Müslümanlığımızı dahi borçluyuz!

Because Abu Ubeyde's good news is not enough for any of us. We want it so much, but we can't believe it until we see it with our own eyes.
Because even for those like us who spent their lives at the center of these issues, an invincible, indestructible, indestructible Israel myth was created. Even we have fallen victim to this biggest lie of our age. These lions of Hamas are what save us most from this captivity.
Consider what a great debt of gratitude we owe to them, in addition to the epics they wrote.
However, our Lord had already given good news in His Book; ""You will find the Jews on earth who hate you most, who love the world most, and who fear death most.""
As you can see, we owe Hamas not only our dignity and honor, but also our faith, belief, creed and Islam, which they reminded us of at a great price!

Abu Ubaida promised you that Netanyahu and his team would come on their knees, and it is not for the saints of God to make false promises, so we promised them that if they promised, they would fulfill them.

Consider the stark contrast in the western media’s treatment of events on October 7 and its treatment of the strike on the car park at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza on October 17, in which hundreds of Palestinians were reported killed.

In the case of Al-Ahli, the media were only too ready to cast aside all the evidence that the hospital had been hit by an Israeli strike, immediately Israel contested the claim. Instead journalists hurriedly amplified Israel’s counter-allegation that a Palestinian rocket had fallen on the hospital. Most of the media moved on after concluding “The truth may never be clear”, or even less credibly, that Palestinian militants were the most likely culprits.

In telling contrast, the western media have not been willing to raise even a single question about what happened on October 7. They have enthusiastically attributed every horror that day to Hamas. They have ignored the reality of utter chaos that reigned for many hours and the potential for poor, desperate and morally dubious decision-making by the Israeli military.

In fact, the media have gone much further. In advancing the narrative of “Hamas as savages”, they have promoted obvious fictions, such as the story that “Hamas beheaded 40 babies”. That piece of fake news was even taken up briefly by US President Joe Biden, before it was quietly walked back by his officials.

Similarly, it is still a popular throwaway line among the western commentariat that “Hamas carried out rapes”, though once again the allegation is evidence-free so far.

We should be clear. If Israel had serious evidence for either of these claims, it would be aggressively promoting it. Instead, it is doing the next best thing: letting innuendo gently sink into the audience’s subconscious, settling there as a prejudice that cannot be interrogated.

Communiqué de presse du Recteur de la grande mosquée de Paris Chemseddine Hafiz en réaction aux critiques qui lui ont adressées suite à son passage sur BFM TV en compagnie du grand rabbin de France Haim Korsia : 

Chers frères et sœurs, que la paix, la miséricorde et les bénédictions d'Allah soient sur vous,

Des semaines avant notre réunion le 7 octobre dernier, le Conseil des Espérances a été la cible d'attaques, de diffamations, ou de tentatives de déstabilisation. Et cela continue. Cependant, loué soit Allah, notre projet et notre conseil restent unis, solides et élevés... et notre fraternité se renforce de plus en plus.
Cette fois-ci, je suis la cible d'une campagne mensongère, menée par des parties louches, motivées par des règlements de comptes honteux et des conspirations visant à ternir l'image de la Grande Mosquée de Paris et à diffamer ma personne. Le respect que j'ai pour chacun d'entre vous m'oblige à expliquer ce qui se passe.

Tout d'abord, j'ai participé avec le grand rabbin de France jeudi dernier à une émission de télévision française intitulée ""L'Appel à la Paix"". Mon objectif en participant à cette émission était de convaincre l'opinion publique et les politiciens français de la nécessité urgente de la paix à Gaza, de l'arrêt immédiat des tirs, de mettre fin aux bombardements meurtriers sur cette ville martyre, de protéger tous les civils, d'assurer l'accès aux aides humanitaires à Gaza, de lever le siège, et enfin, d'établir un État palestinien dans toute la signification du mot, permettant au courageux peuple palestinien de vivre en sécurité.  

Deuxièmement, je n'ai jamais commenté la nature terroriste du Hamas ou non. (Cela signifie que je n'ai jamais dit que le Hamas était un mouvement terroriste, ni le contraire)... J'ai dit qu'il serait injuste de dire que le peuple palestinien est terroriste. Ce qui m'importait, c'était de défendre les innocentes victimes, dont la majorité sont des enfants et des femmes, en raison d'une nouvelle agression meurtrière israélienne, s'ajoutant à d'autres attaques perpétrées par le passé.  

Mais le danger cette fois-ci est plus grand, car cette nouvelle guerre pourrait conduire à un nettoyage ethnique et au déplacement complet des Palestiniens de Gaza, avec des dizaines de milliers de morts.

Nous ne pouvons pas aider nos frères en Palestine par des discours émotionnels ou des surenchères rhétoriques. Nous devons savoir comment adresser le public avec raison et sang-froid. Les Européens doivent voir que nous sommes calmes, même si nous sommes en colère et révoltés. Nous devons savoir comment faire entendre notre voix dans le but de changer les politiques des gouvernements occidentaux concernant la terrible souffrance du peuple palestinien.  

Troisièmement, j'ai personnellement écrit le prêche du dernier vendredi, lu par 150 imams de la Grande Mosquée de Paris dans toute la France, priant Allah de libérer nos frères à Gaza, de les soutenir, et demandant justice et la fin de l'agression, rappelant les valeurs de l'islam en ces moments difficiles. Dans ce prêche que j'ai écrit, j'ai considéré la résistance du peuple palestinien comme légitime pour obtenir ses droits fondamentaux. C'est la position que je m'engage à prendre en compte et à soutenir devant vous.

Mais nous, en tant que dirigeants, voulons changer les choses en profondeur en Europe, pour pouvoir défendre les musulmans en Europe et ailleurs, en particulier en Palestine. C'est pourquoi nous ne pouvons rien dire.

Nous devons être prudents, avant tout, depuis le 7 octobre dernier, les mouvements politiques, et non seulement les extrémistes, aidés par certains intellectuels et médias, utilisent cette date pour attiser l'islamophobie et la haine envers les musulmans. La bataille que nous devons mener ensemble comporte deux aspects : surmonter la peur et la haine envers les musulmans en Europe et convaincre l'opinion publique du terrorisme meurtrier que subissent les Palestiniens, afin que les gouvernements européens agissent pour protéger Gaza et défendre la Palestine, en particulier en appliquant le droit international.

Cette mission est un serment que je prends devant vous en tant qu'homme appartenant à une famille révolutionnaire qui a payé un lourd tribut pendant la guerre de libération en Algérie... Votre frère, Chemseddine Mohammed Hafiz, Recteur de la Grande Mosquée de Paris",2023-11-02T17:24:00.000Z,@Reconquete_off,True,"🔴Questioned about this statement from the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, Éric Zemmour replied that this posture was only Taqîya, to hide his true opinions on Hamas and the jihadist massacres against Israel.

Once again, Éric Zemmour was right. In a press release sent to Muslims, the rector corrects his remarks and explains himself. ⤵️

Press release from the Rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris Chemseddine Hafiz in reaction to the criticism addressed to him following his appearance on BFM TV in the company of the Chief Rabbi of France Haim Korsia:

Dear brothers and sisters, may the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you,

Weeks before our meeting on October 7, the Council of Hopes was the target of attacks, defamation, or attempts at destabilization. And it continues. However, praised be Allah, our project and our council remain united, solid and high... and our brotherhood is growing stronger and stronger.
This time, I am the target of a false campaign, led by shady parties, motivated by shameful score-settling and conspiracies aimed at tarnishing the image of the Grand Mosque of Paris and defaming me. The respect I have for each of you compels me to explain what is happening.

First of all, I participated with the Chief Rabbi of France last Thursday in a French television program called ""L'Appel à la Paix"". My objective in participating in this program was to convince public opinion and French politicians of the urgent need for peace in Gaza, for an immediate stop to the shooting, to put an end to the deadly bombings on this martyr city, to protect all civilians, to ensure access to humanitarian aid in Gaza, to lift the siege, and finally, to establish a Palestinian state in the full meaning of the word, allowing the courageous Palestinian people to live in security.

Second, I have never commented on the terrorist nature of Hamas or not. (This means that I never said that Hamas was a terrorist movement, nor the opposite)... I said that it would be unfair to say that the Palestinian people are terrorists. What was important to me was to defend the innocent victims, the majority of whom are children and women, due to a new deadly Israeli aggression, adding to other attacks perpetrated in the past.

But the danger this time is greater, because this new war could lead to ethnic cleansing and the complete displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, with tens of thousands of deaths.

We cannot help our brothers in Palestine with emotional speeches or rhetorical one-upmanship. We must know how to address the public with reason and composure. Europeans must see that we are calm, even if we are angry and revolted. We must know how to make our voices heard in order to change the policies of Western governments regarding the terrible suffering of the Palestinian people.

Third, I personally wrote the last Friday sermon, read by 150 imams of the Grand Mosque of Paris throughout France, praying to Allah to free our brothers in Gaza, to support them, and asking for justice and an end to the aggression, recalling the values ​​of Islam in these difficult times. In this sermon that I wrote, I considered the resistance of the Palestinian people as legitimate to obtain their fundamental rights. This is the position that I undertake to take into account and support before you.

But we, as leaders, want to change things profoundly in Europe, to be able to defend Muslims in Europe and elsewhere, particularly in Palestine. That's why we can't say anything.

We must be careful, above all, since October 7, political movements, and not only extremists, helped by certain intellectuals and media, have been using this date to fuel Islamophobia and hatred towards Muslims. The battle we must fight together has two aspects: overcoming fear and hatred towards Muslims in Europe and convincing public opinion of the murderous terrorism suffered by Palestinians, so that European governments act to protect Gaza and defend Palestine, in particular by applying international law.

This mission is an oath that I take before you as a man belonging to a revolutionary family who paid a heavy price during the war of liberation in Algeria... Your brother, Chemseddine Mohammed Hafiz, Rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris"

À la suite du 7 octobre, le jeu est terminé : quiconque nuit aux Juifs ou aux citoyens israéliens ne peut avoir qu'un seul destin - quitter ce monde. Une société qui assassine 1 400 Israéliens de toutes les manières cruelles possibles et retient des centaines d'otages devrait être soumise à un siège complet jusqu'à la libération des otages. Nous ne demandons la permission de personne pour exister, ni ne demandons la légitimité pour nous défendre.

Following October 7, the game is over: anyone who harms Jews or Israeli citizens can have only one destiny - to leave this world. A corporation that murders 1,400 Israelis in every cruel way possible and holds hundreds hostage should be subjected to a complete siege until the hostages are released. We do not ask anyone's permission to exist, nor do we ask for legitimacy to defend ourselves.

No sane person would allow a society that regards the pogroms perpetrated by Hamas and Gaza residents as normal to establish an independent political entity on the mountain range overlooking the major population centers of Gaza. 'Israel."

Cependant, Tel Aviv a déclaré à la mi-octobre que le Hezbollah avait décidé de rejoindre le Hamas et qu’il « payait pour cela ».

Il est évident qu’Israël ne se soumettra pas à l’ultimatum du Hezbollah, estimant qu’avec le soutien des États-Unis, il a la force de combattre sur deux fronts à la fois. Cependant, les chances que l’Algérie entre en guerre sont désormais plus grandes que jamais, et l’Iran prépare également le terrain pour une confrontation militaire avec les Israéliens.

💥 En bref, si Nasrallah met sa menace à exécution, il est possible que tous les pays islamiques du Moyen-Orient soient entraînés dans une guerre boule de neige avec Israël. Et puis aucun Dôme de Fer n’aidera Tel Aviv.",2023-11-03T05:42:00.000Z,@BPartisans,True,"🚨 Lebanese Hezbollah issues ultimatum to the United States

The group demanded a cessation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip within the next 24 hours, otherwise threatening war against Israel. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, promises to announce a general mobilization of the Lebanese and to organize operations against the IDF “in all directions”.

❗️ Skirmishes regularly take place on the border between the countries between IDF and Hezbollah militants, although official Lebanon has stressed its reluctance to go to war. However, Tel Aviv said in mid-October that Hezbollah had decided to join Hamas and was ""paying for it.""

It is obvious that Israel will not submit to Hezbollah's ultimatum, believing that with the support of the United States, it has the strength to fight on two fronts at once. However, the chances of Algeria going to war are now greater than ever, and Iran is also preparing the ground for a military confrontation with the Israelis.

💥 In short, if Nasrallah carries out his threat, it is possible that all Islamic countries in the Middle East will be drawn into a snowball war with Israel. And then no Iron Dome will help Tel Aviv."

कुछ प्रश्न हैं ज्ञानीजन कृपया मार्गदर्शन करें 🙏

भारत ने UN में इजराइल के समर्थन से दूरी बनाई, क्यूँ? 
भारत को इस परिस्थिति में अपना पक्ष साफ रखना चाहिए, कोई हमास की इस क्रूरता को कैसे बर्दाश्त कर सकता है :बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू

-भारत ने 🇵🇸 को मेडीकल सहायता भेजी है 
-भारत ने 🇵🇸 को खाद्य सामग्री भेजी है 
-भारत में हमास का समर्थन देखने मिल रहा है
-फिलिस्तीन के समर्थन में बयान आ रहे हैं
-फिलीस्तीन के समर्थन में रैली निकल रही हैं 
-फिलिस्तीन के समर्थन में केंडल मार्च निकले हैं 
-फिलिस्तीन के समर्थन में सभा आयोजित हुई हैं
-सोसल मीडीया पर हमास फिलीस्तीन का जोर-शोर से समर्थन हो रहा है 
-भारत के हजारो लोग इजराइल को आतंकवादी वोल रहे हैं 
-भारत सत्ता विपक्ष फिलिस्तीन को समर्थन दे रहा है 
-भारत ने इजराइल की अबतक कोई अधिकारिक मदद क्यूँ नही की? 

-अब सिर्फ कुछ ही हिन्दू बचे हैं जो अब भी आतंकवाद के खिलाफ इजराइल का समर्थन कर रहे हैं, लेकिन एक बात बताओ हिन्दुओ कि आप अपनी सरकार के खिलाफ कैसे काम कर पाओगे 

-यहाँ तो हिन्दुओ की डबल ढोलकी पिट रही है, क्योंकि भारत के मुसलमान भी हिन्दुओ से सोसल मीडीया पर वहस कर रहे हैं, उधर भारत सरकार भी इजराइल के पक्ष मे नही जा रही है?

-इस परिस्थिति में हम किसी निर्णय पर पहुंचकर बुराई क्यूँ लें? 

-कौन है इजराइल के साथ इस देश में और क्यूँ नही है? 
-क्या भविष्य मे भारत का समर्थन कोई करेगा?
-इजराइल भारत के साथ हर मुसीबत मे खड़ा रहा है।

-भारत के मुसलमानो को भी 7 अक्टूबर के इजराइल पर हुए, आतंकवादी हमले का विरोध करना चाहिए था, जब्कि उल्टा ये आज हमास को समर्थन कर रहे हैं और हमास द्वारा झूठे फर्जी वीडियो फोटो शेयर कर रहे हैं, क्यूँ?

-जब 7 अक्टूबर के इजराइल पर हुए हमले का विरोध भारत सरकार कर चुकी है, तो भारत के मुस्लिम अपने देश की सरकार के साथ क्यूँ नही?
-क्या आप लोग आतंकवाद के खिलाफ नही हो? 
-क्या आप 7 अक्टूबर के उस आतंकी हमले का समर्थन करते हो? 
-क्या आप अपने देश के खिलाफ जाओगे?

भारत सरकार का कोई भी व्यक्ति इस पोस्ट को पढ़े तो कृपया मार्गदर्शन करें, ज्यादा अनुभव नही है जो प्रश्न मन में आए पूछ लिए।",2023-11-03T04:17:00.000Z,@Babymishra_,True,"Israel 🇮🇱 vs Palestine 🇵🇸

I have some questions, please guide me.

India distanced itself from supporting Israel in UN, why?
India should keep its stand clear in this situation, how can anyone tolerate this cruelty of Hamas: Benjamin Netanyahu

-India has sent medical aid to 🇵🇸
-India has sent food items to 🇵🇸
-Hamas support is visible in India
-Statements are coming in support of Palestine
-Rallies are being held in support of Palestine
-Kendal March has come out in support of Palestine
-Meetings have been organized in support of Palestine
-Hamas Palestine is being strongly supported on social media.
-Thousands of people in India are calling Israel terrorists
-India's ruling opposition is supporting Palestine
-Why has India not provided any official help to Israel till now?

-Now only a few Hindus are left who are still supporting Israel against terrorism, but tell me one thing Hindus that how will you be able to work against your government.

- Here the double drum of Hindus is being beaten, because the Muslims of India are also harassing the Hindus on social media, on the other hand, the Indian government is also not going in favor of Israel?

-In this situation, why should we reach a decision and take evil?

-Who is with Israel in this country and why not?
-Will anyone support India in future?
-Israel has stood with India in every trouble.

-Muslims of India should also have protested against the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, whereas on the contrary today they are supporting Hamas and sharing fake videos and photos of Hamas, why?

-When the Indian government has protested against the October 7 attack on Israel, then why are the Muslims of India not with the government of their country?
-Are you not against terrorism?
-Do you support the terrorist attack of October 7?
-Will you go against your country?

If any person from the Government of India reads this post, please guide me, I do not have much experience and ask whatever questions come to my mind."

This is MAJOR.

We were first to report 2 days ago that Hezbollah/Iran warned Israel through the U.S that Hezbollah will join if there is no ceasefire, or at least plans for a ceasefire (see tweet below)

This started materializing in the past few hours, as:

1. Hezbollah received weapons and reinforcements from Syria

2. An Iraqi proxy warned Israel and launched a drone against Israel (very symbolic, as it was from Iraq) 

3. Syria began preparing for a regional war (leaked documents)

Well, a few hours ago, we also reported of a potential 'temporary truce' between Israel and Hamas, again proving the accuracy of our initial report. 

This was the first piece of good news received in days.

WHAT'S NEXT?

In a few hours, Hezbollah's leader will be giving a highly anticipated speech that we will be streaming and analyzing.

My prediction is that, if no truce deal is reached, and Israel continues with the current strategy, Hezbollah will enter the war.

STATEMENT REFERENCED ABOVE:

Here's the statement by the Ebrahim Valipour, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Islamic Republic of Iran, Director of Department of Palestine and Jordan:

""From tomorrow, the Zionist regime's cabinet will have to accept a ground withdrawal from the Gaza region and accelerate the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

If not, it should embrace the greater volume of attacks from the northern front.

The US will have to watch new equations in the region from tomorrow.

Nach Angaben der UN (UNRWA) wurden in den letzten 24 Stunden in Gaza vier Schulen beschädigt, die als Schutzräume genutzt werden.

Das israelische Militär hat Gaza-Stadt nach eigenen Angaben umzingelt und rückt weiter vor. Sprecher Hagari fügte hinzu, dass ein Waffenstillstand trotz internationalen Drucks „nicht zur Debatte steht"".

Der Vormarsch der Armee treibt immer mehr Palästinenser in Gaza-Stadt dazu, verzweifelt einen sicheren Zufluchtsort zu suchen, unter anderem im Al-Shifa-Krankenhaus.

Experten der Vereinten Nationen sind davon überzeugt, dass das palästinensische Volk angesichts der unablässigen Angriffe Israels „von einem Völkermord bedroht ist"".

Die Kämpfe an der israelisch-libanesischen Grenze zwischen Hisbollah und Israel verschärfen sich.

Der US-Senat hat 14 Milliarden Dollar zur Unterstützung Israels zugestimmt.

Das Weiße Haus denkt über temporäre Waffenpausen (nicht Waffenruhe) für humanitäre Hilfe nach.

Mittlerweile ist der 36. Journalist getötet worden.

Bahrein rief seinen Botschafter aus Israel zurück.

Israels Armee meldet den Verlust von 20 Soldaten seit Dienstag.

According to the UN (UNRWA), four schools used as shelters were damaged in Gaza in the last 24 hours.

The Israeli military says it has surrounded Gaza City and is continuing to advance. Spokesman Hagari added that despite international pressure, a ceasefire ""is not up for debate.""

The army's advance is driving more and more Palestinians in Gaza City to desperately seek safe refuge, including at Al-Shifa Hospital.

United Nations experts are convinced that the Palestinian people are ""at risk of genocide"" in the face of Israel's relentless attacks.

Fighting on the Israeli-Lebanese border between Hezbollah and Israel is intensifying.

The US Senate has approved $14 billion to support Israel.

The White House is considering temporary ceasefires (not ceasefires) for humanitarian aid.

The 36th journalist has now been killed.

Bahrain recalled its ambassador to Israel.

Israel's army reports the loss of 20 soldiers since Tuesday.

The main generator at Al Shifa Hospital is no longer working. There is a lack of fuel due to the blockage."

In october 29, 1956 Israel was a military regime. It put a curfew on Palestinian villages(who has citizenship) at 9pm, including Kafr Qassem. But on this day, the curfew was moved to 5pm. This decision was taken at 1pm, the mayor of Kofr Qassem was told at 4.30pm. 

Hundreds of Palestinian workers were out in fields, unaware of the curfew. The Israeli border guard made no effort to tell the workers, what did the IDF commander Isaachar Shadmi say about Palestinians out past curfew? “I don’t want sentimentality; i don’t want detainees”.

When asked to clarify his words, he said: “may God have mercy on them”, he ordered to indiscriminately kill every Palestinian out past curfew.

In a truck…on their way home from the fields..47 Palestinian citizens were stopped by the Israeli border guard, they were lined up and shot dead.

Israel imposed a two month ban on media reporting on the crime,after outrage, protest and global pressure, 11 soldiers were put on trial and 8 were convicted, Israel tried to evade the crime by setting up mock trials for the soldiers, they were sentenced to 15-17 years in prison, then it was reduced until all soldiers were released.

But the worst part is Isaachar Shadmi’s trial. Shadami was acquitted, he was only found guilty of exceeding his authority in extending curfew, he walked free, only having to pay symbolic $ 0.01

When will justice be served?

B'Tselem said: “Since the start of the war, armed settlers, sometimes accompanied by soldiers, have beaten some residents, attacked others with stones, damaged property and threatened community members with serious injury. They didn't leave the place. Settler violence is only one component of Israeli policy aimed at evicting communities. The Palestinians know that no one will come to their aid, the army and the police refuse to protect them.

""Los 2.000 jóvenes que irrumpieron en las puertas de Gaza el 7 de octubre de 2023 habían nacido en un campo de concentración. Durante dos décadas habían estado encerrados en una franja de tierra de 40 kilómetros de largo por 8 kilómetros de ancho que se encontraba entre los lugares más densamente poblados del mundo.

La gran mayoría de ellos nunca podría esperar salir sino sólo caminar cada día por el asfixiante perímetro del campo; nunca aspires a un empleo remunerado ni a comer una comida completa; Nunca esperes casarte o formar una familia. Abandonados por todos, fueron “restados” para languidecer y morir.

Para acelerar este proceso, Israel lanzó periódicamente “operaciones” que provocaron muerte y destrucción en Gaza: miles de personas fueron acribilladas metódicamente; hogares e infraestructuras críticas pulverizadas sistemáticamente.

Puede parecer el guión de una mala película de serie B, pero la noche del 6 de octubre cada uno de esos 2.000 hombres probablemente dio un beso de despedida a su madre y luego a su padre. Para siempre. Y luego cada uno de ellos prometió en silencio reivindicar la tortura implacable de una existencia crepuscular y vengar el asesinato de un abuelo, una hermana, un hermano, una sobrina y un sobrino por ese poder satánico que maldijo sus vidas"".

Vía @upholdreality",2023-11-02T00:28:00.000Z,@RoiLopezRivas,True,"Probably one of the best descriptions of life in Gaza, by Prof. Norman Finkelstein:

""The 2,000 young people who stormed the gates of Gaza on October 7, 2023 had been born in a concentration camp. For two decades they had been locked in a strip of land 40 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide that was between the most densely populated places in the world.

The vast majority of them could never hope to go out but only walk every day along the suffocating perimeter of the field; never aspire to gainful employment or to eat a full meal; Never expect to get married or start a family. Abandoned by all, they were “remained” to languish and die.

To accelerate this process, Israel periodically launched “operations” that caused death and destruction in Gaza: thousands of people were methodically gunned down; homes and critical infrastructure systematically pulverized.

It may sound like the script of a bad B movie, but on the night of October 6, each of those 2,000 men probably kissed his mother and then his father goodbye. Forever. And then each of them silently vowed to vindicate the relentless torture of a twilight existence and avenge the murder of a grandfather, a sister, a brother, a niece and a nephew by that satanic power that cursed their lives.""

Oleh Anwar Hudijono, jurnalis senior tinggal di Sidoarjo.

PWMU.CO – Gregetan melihat kekejaman Israel terhadap rakyat Palestina, akhirnya keceplosan berucap “Mengapa Tuhan membiarkan Zionis itu merajalela. Kok gak dilempit saja. Kan Tuhan itu adil dan perkasa?”

Pertanyaan demikian wajar-wajar belaka untuk orang awam. Tapi akan berbeda manakala kita simak hakikat kehidupan yang sudah dicetakbirukan Tuhan.

Dalam cetak biru Allah kemenangan atua kejayaan dan kekalahan atau keterpurukan digilir antarmanusia.

Dan masa (kejayaan dan kehancuran) itu, Kami pergilirkan di antara manusia (agar mereka mendapat pelajaran), dan agar Allah membedakan orang-orang yang beriman (dengan orang-orang kafir) dan agar sebagian kamu dijadikan-Nya (gugur sebagai) syuhada. Dan Allah tidak menyukai orang-orang zalim.” (Ali ‘Imran 140)

Tujuan pergiliran itu untuk membedakan siapa yang kafir dan yang mukmin. Siapa yang adil dan yang dzalim. Dan membuka peluang mati syahid.

Selain itu untuk membersihkan dosa orang beriman. Menderita, sakit, lapar, terjajah, teraniaya itu cara Allah membersihkan dosa mereka. Bahkan luka tertusuk jarum pun menghapus dosa.

Juga cara Allah mau membinasakan kaum kafir.

“Dan agar Allah membersihkan orang-orang yang beriman (dari dosa mereka) dan membinasakan orang-orang kafir.” (Ali ‘Imran 3 141)

Dalam masa pergiliran itu juga dibuka peluang jihad dan sabar di mana keduanya adalah jalan ke surga.

“Apakah kamu mengira bahwa kamu akan masuk surga, padahal belum nyata bagi Allah orang-orang yang berjihad di antara kamu, dan belum nyata orang-orang yang sabar.” (Ali ‘Imran 3 142)

“(sambil mengucapkan), “Selamat sejahtera atasmu karena kesabaranmu.” Maka alangkah nikmatnya tempat kesudahan itu.” (ar-Ra’d 24)

Jalan surga itu sekarang terbentang luas di Gaza. Berjihad mengangkat senjata, membantu sesama, melakukan diplomasi melawan penindasan (fasad). Tentu saja sabar menghadapi ujian bertubi-tubi mulai kelaparan, terhina, sakit bahkan mati. Saat ini tidak ada yang kesabarannya melampaui rakyat Gaza.

Jadi dalam konsep pergiliran, saat ini rakyat Gaza yang mayoritas Muslim sedang dalam posisi kalah. Sedang Yahudi sedang dalam posisi menang setelah lebih 2000 tahun terpuruk.

Dalam posisi jaya atau menang ini Yahudi telah berbuat fasad, zalim, ugal-ugalan. Dan pasti akan menerima hukuman Allah atas perbuatannya itu. Itu sudah jadi ketentuan Allah yang terbukti berulang-ulang dalam sejarah manusia. Ingat Firaun, Namrud, kaum Ad, Tsamud.

“Dan kamu sama sekali tidak dapat melepaskan diri (dari azab Allah) baik di bumi maupun di langit, dan tidak ada pelindung dan penolong bagimu selain Allah.”
(al-‘Ankabut 22)

Kapan terjadi? Persisnya kita tidak tahu. Bisa saja terjadi dengan tiba-tiba seperti jika Allah turun tangan sendiri menghukum musuh-musuh-Nya.

Lihat, Firaun pasti tak pernah menduga kalau akan ditelah ombak. Umat Nabi Luth tidak pernah mengantisipasi akan hujan batu dan buminya dibalik saat orang tertidur lelap.

“Maka adapun kaum Samud, mereka telah dibinasakan dengan suara yang sangat keras.” (al-Haqqah 5)

“Sedangkan kaum `Ad, mereka telah dibinasakan dengan angin topan yang sangat dingin.” (al-Haqqah 6)

“Dan (ada lagi) karunia yang lain yang kamu sukai (yaitu) pertolongan dari Allah dan kemenangan yang dekat (waktunya). Dan sampaikanlah berita gembira kepada orang-orang mukmin.” (as-Saff 13)

Kita tunggu sambil riyadhah. Rabbi a’lam

Such questions are only natural for lay people. But it will be different when we look at the essence of life that has been shaped by God.

In God's blueprint, victory or glory and defeat or adversity are rotated between humans.

And those times (of glory and destruction), We passed among mankind (so that they might learn a lesson), and that Allah might distinguish those who believe (from those who disbelieve) and that He may make some of you (fall as) martyrs. And Allah does not like unjust people."" (Ali 'Imran 140)

The purpose of the rotation is to differentiate between those who are disbelievers and those who are believers. Who is just and who is unjust. And opens up opportunities for martyrdom.

Apart from that, it is to cleanse the sins of believers. Suffering, illness, hunger, colonization, persecution are God's ways of cleansing their sins. Even a needle stick can wash away sins.

Also the way Allah wants to destroy the infidels.

""And that Allah may cleanse those who believe (from their sins) and destroy those who disbelieve."" (Ali 'Imran 3 141)

During this period, opportunities for jihad and patience are also opened, both of which are the way to heaven.

""Do you think that you will enter Paradise, even though Allah has not yet revealed those who strive among you, and those who are patient have not yet appeared?"" (Ali 'Imran 3 142)

""(while saying), ""Good luck to you because of your patience."" So how delicious is that final place."" (ar-Ra'd 24)

The road to heaven now stretches wide in Gaza. Jihad takes up arms, helps others, carries out diplomacy against oppression (fasad). Of course, you have to be patient in facing repeated tests, starting from hunger, humiliation, illness and even death. Currently, no one has more patience than the people of Gaza.

So in the concept of rotation, currently the people of Gaza, who are predominantly Muslim, are in a losing position. Meanwhile, the Jews are in a winning position after more than 2000 years of decline.

In this position of victory or victory, the Jews have acted in a fake, unjust and reckless manner. And will definitely receive God's punishment for his actions. That has been God's provision which has been proven over and over again in human history. Remember Pharaoh, Namrud, the people of Ad, Thamud.

""And you cannot escape at all (from Allah's punishment) neither on earth nor in heaven, and there is no protector and helper for you besides Allah.""
(al-'Ankabut 22)

When did it happen? We don't know exactly. It could happen suddenly, such as if God personally intervened to punish His enemies.

Look, Pharaoh certainly never expected that he would be swallowed by the waves. Prophet Lut's people never anticipated that it would rain stones and the earth would turn over while people were fast asleep.

""So as for the people of Samud, they were destroyed with a very loud noise."" (al-Haqqah 5)

""As for the people of `Ad, they were destroyed by a very cold hurricane."" (al-Haqqah 6)

""And (there are) other gifts that you like (namely) help from Allah and victory that is near (time). And convey good news to the believers."" (as-Saff 13)

Let's wait while we pray. Rabbi a'lam

Comme en outre vous ne demandez un cessez-le-feu qu'en vous adressant à Israël que vous cherchez à faire passer pour un État criminel en brandissant à longueur de temps les images des frappes israéliennes sur Gaza, vous ne pouvez pas ignorer que si Israël cesse de se défendre, il cessera aussi d'exister dans les heures et les jours qui suivront. 
La situation est certes difficile, et moi-même, qui n'abdique pas mon esprit critique et qui suis tout à fait prêt à admettre une part de responsabilité du côté israélien dans cette situation devenue inextricable, je dis clairement ce qui est, sans haine ni parti pris : l'existence d'Israël et la survie de sa population commande à ceux qui dirigent ce pays de ne pas baisser la garde et de neutraliser définitivement le Hamas qui est décidé lui aussi à en finir.

As, moreover, you only ask for a ceasefire by addressing Israel, which you seek to pass off as a criminal state by constantly brandishing images of Israeli strikes on Gaza, you cannot ignore that if Israel ceases to defend itself, it will also cease to exist in the hours and days that follow.
The situation is certainly difficult, and I myself, who do not abandon my critical spirit and who am entirely ready to admit a part of responsibility on the Israeli side in this situation which has become inextricable, I say clearly what is, without hatred nor bias: the existence of Israel and the survival of its population requires those who lead this country not to let down their guard and to definitively neutralize Hamas, which is also determined to put an end to it.
Also, from your useless calls for a ceasefire, I conclude that you also want to put an end to Israel. It must be said. The time has come for clarity.

O líder supremo do Hezbollah falará ao mundo às 15h00 ( horário local) em Beirute, entretanto há rumores (a confirmar) que o Wagner grupo (o grupo russo mais forte do mundo em guerrilha urbana) está chegando no Líbano, enquanto o Irã, a Síria, o Egito e o Iêmen, colocaram seus exércitos em alerta máximo, prontos para a batalha.

 A câmara dos EUA aprovou uma emenda que dá luz verde ao exército para impedir que o Irã adquira armas nucleares de qualquer forma, autorizando assim o  ataque preventivo - esquecendo que o Irã, a Rússia, a China e a Coreia do Norte (todas potências nucleares) assinaram um pacto de colaboração e apoio militar entre eles.

Enquanto isso, Putin assinou a lei que revoga a ratificação do Tratado de Proibição de Testes nucleares.  
O Tratado de 1996 proíbe todas as explosões nucleares, incluindo testes ao vivo de armas nucleares - mas nunca entrou em vigor porque alguns países chaves como: Estados Unidos e China, nunca ratificaram.

 The US House approved an amendment giving the military the green light to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons in any form, thus authorizing the preemptive strike - forgetting that Iran, Russia, China and North Korea (all nuclear powers) ) signed a pact of collaboration and military support between them.

Meanwhile, Putin signed the law revoking the ratification of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.
The 1996 Treaty prohibits all nuclear explosions, including live testing of nuclear weapons - but it never came into force because some key countries, such as the United States and China, never ratified it.

3943,Northern variant,1720182775758684441,494,21,32,119,Israel,"I actually have more respect for Islamists than liberal lefties. Islamists say what they mean and they mean what they say. When they say ""from the river to the sea"" they really do mean the destruction of Israel and the eradication of the Jews. Lefties, however, pretend it means something else.

As far as I can discern, lefties believe the state of Israel should be abolished because it's a ""racist, ethnonationalist, apartheid abomination"". But unlike Islamists, and because lefties never think through the consequences of what they say, they actually believe what replaces Israel will be a peaceful, progressive, secular state where Jews, Muslims and Christians all rub along nicely. This is their ""one state solution"". 

But we don't have to speculate what would actually happen. We have a living example of this exact dynamic emerging in real-time. Think South Africa.

South Africa was an actual racist, apartheid state. But it was also a functioning country. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending apartheid, but what we've seen since is the rise of grievance politics (Marxism in a racial justice shroud) which, left unchecked, will see ethnic cleansing of whites from South Africa, the confiscation of their farms. On a long enough timeline, the water, telecoms and energy system will completely collapse under the weight of the corruption. The black factions will split, and split again, and then turn on each other, and then there's be a bloodbath and a famine in which millions die. We've seen this repeated across Africa where breadbaskets turn to basket cases. 

So imagine then what happens if the world decides to delegitimise Israel, the UN revokes recognition and the US stops supplying arms. In all probability Arab militias from neighbouring countries will move in, and they'll get to work cleansing the entire region of Jews. And when they're done with Jews, they'll go after the Christians and anyone else who isn't Muslim. And when they're done, they'll turn on each other. They probably won't even wait that long. Arabs hate Palestinians and Palestinians (being of diverse origins) tend to hate each other. Bedouins are viewed as the regions Roma. (Israeli Bedouins are safer under Israeli rule). 

Israel as it stands is a largely functioning country and the closest the region has ever got to a liberal democracy but what replaces it will not be a unified state of Palestine for Palestinians. It will be yet another corrupt Arab slum, where everything the Israelis built will be destroyed. The farms, the universities, the factories, the laboratories, the roads... will all be looted and left to fall into decay. Essentially a hybrid of Afghanistan/Libya and Lebanon. 

There are some on the right who say the Israeli-Palestine issue is none of our business, but Europe cannot afford this to happen. Israel's survival is very much in our interests. We saw waves of mass immigration at the height of the Syrian civil war, and we'd likely see similar. Half of Gaza would depart for Europe. That's the great irony of the Palestinian struggle. If they they had it their way, they wouldn't even want to live there. Israel is only a functioning and prosperous place because Israelis are nation builders. 

Arabs have never shown any such initiative in building the foundations of a Palestinian state. They embezzle aid, they destroy infrastructure, and blame Israel for their every failing. In all probability, the Palestinian state would rapidly descend into a state of civil war, probably destabilising Jordan in the process, resulting in a Jordanian civil war where the Hashemites brutalise Palestinians in a way the world has never seen. For a region that has been in a state of low grade war since before I was born, we would end up looking at the Israel era as a time of relative peace.

Lefties and Palestinians reject a two state solution because they ultimately want to abolish Israel. Israel rejects a two state solution because they know there is no genuine desire for one - and no observable efforts to build one. So a one state solution is the only solution on the table. 

So the question is, is it going to be a Jewish state where Jews can live in peace and safety, with at least some rights for Palestinians (better than Jews would have were the situation reversed), or one where Jews and Christians are massacred, that rapidly devolves into anarchy and destitution? If it's the former, then the fastest route to the best normal we will ever get, is the eradication of Hamas.
