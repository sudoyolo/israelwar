The law would give the interior minister special war-time powers allowing them to remove the citizenship of individuals deemed to be supporting or encouraging terrorism. Rather than go to the courts, the minister would only need the approval of the justice minister"".

It obviously depends how they define ""expressing solidarity with terror groups"" but given the fact the interpretation of it seems to be at the discretion of the current government - bypassing due legal process in court - it's fair to assume the definition will be very broad... For instance it'd be easy to make the case that someone who opposes the assault on Gaza for the enormous amount of civilian deaths is ""expressing solidarity with Hamas""...

It is so cruel to see the children of Gaza going to hospital instead of school, and being bombed instead of playing and enjoying life.

We are trying to demonstrate, to educate, and make the world aware of the injustices and cruelty of this criminal entity called ""Israel"". Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel. 

You are truly such a strong and brave people. We believe in you. We are proud of you. You, the people of Palestine, you the people of Gaza, you have shown us what a homeland means to the people whom it truly belongs to.

People of Palestine, people of Gaza, you really resemble your olive trees, whose roots are so deep in this land. Unshakeable. The world with all its might and weapons could never break you because God is in your heart and His words are your swords.

Everyone, from East to West is up in arms about the images that are coming out of Gaza. We support you with our hearts, with our minds, and with our prayers. We are all trying to do our bit, to make your voices, your suffering, and your needs heard. We will never shut up about this genocide. We will get justice for you, whatever it takes.

We know the big powers have abandoned you and betrayed you; they persecute you, just like they persecuted Jesus. But just as Jesus was resurrected, so will Palestine be resurrected. Your pain became the pain of all humankind. The names ""Gaza"" and ""Palestine"" thunder across the globe, as armies of people march for you. And why wouldn't they? Are you not the Defenders of al Aqsa, and the Guardians of al Quds?

This balance allows Hezbollah to grind the Israeli military in northern Palestine without igniting a war of mass destruction. 

Lebanon can fire missiles at Tel Aviv, but instead of crying for Palestinian children, you will double your cries and cry for Lebanese children too, the scope of massacres will double.

Why double the massacres when you can do military operations without full scale war ?

Why was Hamas hiding in the tunnels? Were they going to catch the bombs dropped from the planes with their hands? You won't ask that, you will ask why the cowardly Israeli dogs couldn't enter by land, why they couldn't confront Hamas and fight face to face, but instead massacred innocent people with planes. When they entered with tanks, you will talk about whether Hamas ran away or fought like lions.
Why did the Israeli terrorists abandon their eighty-ton tanks and run away in the face of foot soldiers? That's what you're going to ask, not talk about things.
Why does Hamas wear masks? That's why Turkish soldiers wear them, my idiot friend.
You will ask not why Hamas attacked, why it took civilians hostage, but why the dogs, which have been killing even defenseless innocent Palestinian children who have been playing on the streets for years, abandoned their own citizens and ran away when Hamas responded.
You will ask why those Palestinians, whom you call civilians, expelled them from their homes at gunpoint and settled in those houses, why the world turned a blind eye when they killed the resisting Palestinians, and why those terrorists, whom you call civilians, were not held accountable to anyone.
And you know, if you can't be, you have to be a little young man. I am an enemy of Islam, I get happy when Muslims are massacred, Israel is the one who commits the massacre, but I still want to blame the Muslims, that's why you can't say I'm bullshitting, but you won't make hypocritical sentences that start with ""we are also Muslims, but..."".
You won't applaud those who say, ""Europe won't take us in, if they did, I'd even be willing to be a garbage collector, I'd be shit in Norway,"" and when a Muslim community is attacked, you won't act nationalist and say, ""We're Turks, what do we care about them?"" You won't worry about the Uyghurs, whom you normally don't care about and who only come to your mind when other Muslims are in trouble.
You don't become a Turk by waltzing and setting off firecrackers on the Republic Day, you are not even a human being, let alone a Turk, a person who comments on the murder of babies by looking at their race and religion, who is devoid of humanity, who does not embrace the country he lives in, who is not respected by the countries he admires, who has assimilated in vain, who is stateless, nationalless, spiritualless, in limbo.

1719350058905182260,"In the wake of the horrific massacre by Gaza-based terrorists of over a thousand Israelis, Israel’s Defense Minister @yoavgallant announced a “complete siege” of the territory. Some have wrongly interpreted that to mean that Israel supplied, and is now cutting off, all of Gaza's water, electricity, & food. 

Here are the facts.

Water:

Gaza is an oasis with its own water supply. But many Gaza residents have drilled wells wherever they wanted, leading to vast overuse and saltwater infiltration from the sea, and Hamas made no effort to stop this until 2021, when the aquifer's water quality had already been severely damaged.

Israel has long supplemented Gaza's supply by providing water through the Kissufim pipeline, and in recent years has increased the supply of water through new pipelines. In 2021, Israel supplied 14.4 MCM of water to Gaza, while 192.5 MCM was drawn from the aquifer under Gaza.

So when Gallant said Israel was cutting off the water, he was only referring to the approximately 14 MCM, and even that didn't last long - on October 29 Israel announced that two out of the three pipelines into Gaza had been reopened.

Electricity:

Gaza mainly gets its electricity from the Israel Electric Company (subsidized by Israeli taxpayers), the power plant run by Gaza Power Generating Company which burns diesel fuel, and solar panels; Gaza is in fact a world leader in solar power.

During the October 7 attacks, 9 out of 10 of the transmission lines that connect the Gaza power grid to Israel were cut. So apparently, some believe that even though Hamas attacks cut the power lines, Israel is obligated to repair them and then supply power to Hamas at its own expense.

And while Israel stopped diesel deliveries to Gaza after October 7, Hamas is estimated to have enough fuel and supplies stored for months of fighting in their subterranean bases and tunnels; they could share it with the civilians they supposedly protect, but seem to have chosen not to.

Food:

While Gaza did import food and other goods through Kerem Shalom, the crossing point was attacked by Hamas on October 7 and is currently a war zone. Moreover, Gaza produces more food than the local market can absorb and much of it is exported.

Any food problems Gazan civilians are currently experiencing are not due to Israel's decision to impose a siege, but Hamas's decision to impose an all-out war on Israel.",Gaza,negative

The Israeli Foreign Ministry has said that countries that do not support Tel Aviv's right to ""defend itself"" against militants are supporters of Hamas. These countries also include Russia – Russia’s permanent representative to the UN previously said that Israel, as occupier, does not have the “right of self-defense”.

💬 “I want to send a very clear message to the international community: if you do not condemn Hamas, if you do not support Israel's right to self-defense, then you support Hamas. You are either on the side of Israel or on the side of Hamas,” said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Hayat.

In Israel's eyes, the ""correct"" countries of course include the United States and its Western puppets. Not only have states failed to condemn the IDF's actions in Gaza, but they have also, unlike the entire UN community, refused to recognize Israel as having committed war crimes.

I have called for peace, a ceasefire, and even a call to at least allow the women and children to leave. I have never once said I'm pro-terror or pro-Hamas. 

This shows the lengths Israel will go to censor people who call for peace and spread fake news to remove them from their positions. 

An anonymous person wrote my ""employer"" three times in one hour with the title ""Please investigate this.""

First stating that I denied 40 infants were killed. 
The post she mentions has nothing to do with babies and I have never written about the babies. It was a direct screenshot from the DOJ, part of history that I don't feel Israelis would deny on how Britain was forced out of Israel by three Zionist terrorist groups.  

Second, she reiterates propaganda that again I think everyone would disagree, Israel like many countries was not started in peace. This is trying to influence my ""employer"" into thinking I am evil, picking on a peace-loving nation. 

The third message states something that has never been on my timeline and doesn't really make sense. These are obviously bot messages, one email is kind of true about the militias but the rest is out of place. My entire timeline never mentions those things.  

I traced the IP address and replied with an ip trace image embedded. The fact that this was a targeted attack with fake information and IP information
led me to believe this was with certainty an organized attack.

To spread misinformation about a person is illegal, on top of it to do it to try to remove someone from their position is even more illegal.

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the UN in New York, just bluntly threatened individual American officials with violence: “I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome (an) expansion of the war in the region. But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.” (Emphasis added.)

I don’t think Mr. Amir-Abdollahian would come into our country to issue such a direct threat to American leaders had the Biden administration not assigned Robert Malley to reboot the atrocious but then-inert Iran Deal, had it not lifted oil export sanctions--resulting in a multibillion-dollar windfall to Tehran, had it not tried to ransom American hostages from Iran at $1.2 billion a captive, had it not restored hundreds of millions of dollars in support to the West Bank and Gaza, had it not allowed U.S. aid and remittance dollars to Lebanon to seep into Hezbollah coffers, had it not dropped past American  declarations that the Houthis were a terrorist organization, and had it not ignored rather than retaliated for dozens of attacks on US forces in Syria and Iraq by Iranian surrogates.

We should also take at his word one Ghazi Hamad.

He’s a high official in Hamas and one of their PR megaphones. And in an October 24 Lebanese television interview, Hamad  boasted: “We must teach Israel a lesson…and we will do this again and again. The Al Aqsa Flood [the October 7 attack] is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth…It is Israel, not us. We are the victims of the occupation…On Oct. 7, on Oct. 10, on October one-millionth, everything we do is justified…”

Hamad was quite clear on the motivation for his envisioned million more murder sprees: “The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears.”

So Hamad is promising more beheading, executions, rape, and mutilation. I don’t think Hamad—apparently waging endless jihad against Israeli civilians from a safe distance in Beirut—got the message about the much-heralded American “two-state solution” of mutual co-existence.

In other words, Hamad has no problem adhering to the Hamas-charter agenda of wiping out Israel: “Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nations, and must be finished.”

So is this final solution to Israel the “from the river to the sea” envisioned by our campus activists?

Our Turkish NATO ally Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at a huge public rally, praised the Hamas mass murderers as “freedom fighters.” He declared the Israeli response to the Hamas apparat a “massacre,” and threatened to send the Turkish army to Gaza and to hit Israel with a swarm of missiles and bombs--or as he put it, his military can “come at any night unexpectedly.” (He issued the same sort of surprise aerial threat not long ago to NATO member Greece.)

Such is our Turkish NATO ally. It has the largest military of the alliance aside from the U.S., is home to a huge American air base at Incirlik that is reportedly still-equipped with nuclear weapons, has collaterally bombed Kurdish civilians in Syria and Iraq, and for the last half-century has propped up the permanent Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus that drove 150,000-200,000 Greeks from their homes. And, amid his denunciations of Israeli “genocide” and “massacre,” the moralist and former Obama conduit to Middle East, Erdogan sometimes talks about how an earlier Turkish generation dealt with the Armenians–as a matter of pride rather than shame.

Remember that all of these creepy leaders have at one time or another been (or currently are) recipients of U.S. cash, but are comfortably far away. Now they are buoyed by, and voicing  sentiments identical to, their thousands of spiritual kindred on our own campuses.",Palestine,negative

Those who, in secret cabinets or consulting firms, think about and develop communication strategies. Because yes, with Macron, we think Communication only and not the interest of the French. Unlike what's happening here. So what can we do to stop this loss of position? Everything is allowed and, like billiards, strategies with several cushions.

Remember on September 5, 2023, the Créteil court refused the request of an association which wanted to allow WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to request “political” asylum in France, the country of supposed freedoms.

This very political decision was also made in Créteil, strangely, Valls is not very far away and this gave certain ideas. Valls, in order to relaunch his political career, should not have used relationships to encourage the courts to rule against this request. Winking smiley.

But Macron's thinkers were quicker and suggested that, faced with his repeated failures in diplomacy, he play one last card: save Assange to emerge as the hero.

This is one of his last chances to avoid being seen as an autocratic censor. He is apparently extremely jealous of @elonmusk like Bernard Arnault who, privately, says he does not understand why he is not loved as much as Elon, being as rich.

@EmmanuelMacron understood the move to play. He sent Cédric Villani, in a bad position, also following the non-publication of the final report on the side effects of vaccination (we will talk about that again). So Villani is urgently mandated to do the job for him.

As he is bound by the system, he had no choice in executing. Macron now thinks he is sure to regain his virginity by supporting Assange. This is his last cartridge.

It’s their fault and they deserve it”. I’ve met many who went believing Israel were the good guys and Palestinians screwed themselves over only to come back with an entirely disgusted view of Israel. 

I came back in a state of shock. I witnessed in real life things I had only read about in history books. Things I never believed a government could do in modern times. I had a neutral view of Israel prior to my trip. During my trip I was extremely skeptical and even pissed off several Palestinians with my lines of questioning. When I came back to the states and began processing everything… I couldn’t turn on the lights or get myself out of bed for a week. What I saw was unimaginable. It was a cruelty aimed at a group of generous and warm people with a very very clear intent- to get rid of them. And I couldn’t believe the group doing it to these people had it done to them not long ago. They took similar tactics and weaponized them against others. That is what I saw and I can’t unsee it. The children in the schools would stop me and beg me to come home and tell America to stop. They know it’s us allowing this abuse. 

Myself and everyone I know comes back disgusted with Israel. And many of us weren’t even in Gaza witnessing war. Everyday normal life for Palestinians is cruel and it’s 100% controlled by Israel. And despite what we’ve been spoon fed our whole lives, it’s not done because the Palestinians are violent and dangerous, it’s done to rid the region of them. To make their lives so miserable they either leave or violently rise up giving Israel an excuse to take more land. And the Israelis are not shy about this when you speak to them. Some might couch it with statements like “well we tried peace but they didn’t accept it”. It doesn’t matter how they phrase it, they still end up in the same place which is “they can’t stay” and “we want them gone”.",Palestine,negative

They did. In 2018, thousands of Palestinians took part in 'The Great March of Return', demanding they be freed from Israel's blockade and granted their right of return to their ancestral homeland.

Over 70 percent of the population of Gaza are considered refugees, expelled from or descended from people expelled from Palestine in the so-called Nakba, Israel's ethnic cleansing of the land in 1948.

The protestors demanded right of return, and an end to the blockade of Gaza, which is illegal under law as a form of collective punishment but has persisted since 2006.

Israel responded by shooting the peaceful protestors, treating anyone approaching the fence around Gaza as a legitimate target - including children, the disabled, and medics. Human rights groups universally condemned this targeting of peaceful protestors.

Between the first protest and November 2019, more than 35 thousand protestors were injured, 7,996 with live ammo.

1720252901543534762,"🚨🚨BREAKING UDPATES: Truce Discussions Between Hamas and Israel | Hezbollah Shift in Stance?

- The discussions include a daytime calm for several hours

- Hamas has not yet agreed to the terms of the potential truce

- Includes bringing 50,000 liters of fuel per day into Gaza

🚨MY THOUGHTS:

This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Here's why:

- I posted 2 days ago a warning by Hezbollah and Iran to the U.S that if there is no truce, or at least plans for truce in the near future, Hezbollah will join the war

- Since then, we saw very serious escalations across Iranian proxies in the past few hours

- We've also seen the rhetoric from the 'Axis of Resistance' shift

- Since then, today I put out a statement telling people in Lebanon to leave immediately, and I thought it is more likely than not that Hezbollah and allies will declare war on Israel.

- However, now that we have reports of a possible truce (which doesn't entirely surprise me), my level of concern drops significantly and my stance goes back to what is was prior to 2 days ago: Hezbollah is unlikely to join the war.

Things are changing by the hour. We will keep you all updated 24x7.

1720040463392997805,"Cuba 🇨🇺 and Palestine 🇵🇸, two brother peoples blocked by the US and Israel

Cuba and Palestine are two brother peoples that are blocked by two enemies of Peace and allies of each other, the US and Israel, who intend to starve them into submission to facilitate a coup against their governments, or directly exterminate them.

On Cuba, the United States imposes a premeditated and sustained war in a time of “peace” through an economic blockade of more than 60 years that slowly kills the people by depriving them of the vital conditions of food and health, and that affects the entire society as a whole; Israel murders Palestine daily through an unjust and unjustified war and a physical blockade that also prevents it from accessing its most basic needs; Both blockades and attacks are carried out with total impunity through State terrorism that occupies their lands, displaces or disappears their inhabitants and their towns, attacks militarily and tries to prevent their survival as a nation.

In the face of so much aggression, the victims not only resist and defend themselves, but also show solidarity with each other: Cuban diplomacy, based on firm principles of solidarity and respect for the sovereignty of the people, has always defended Palestine against the aggression of Israel, regardless of the political cost; There are many Palestinian teachers and doctors trained in Cuba who today resist or die under the bombs of Israel, bought from the US and some other Western power, such as Spain.

Palestine has always been at Cuba's side in the fight against the blockade and is an ally in building a world that includes the impoverished countries of the South.

Historically, leaders Yasir Arafat and Fidel Castro have been twinned in multiple diplomatic battles, and their speeches are still remembered and studied as they have such a strong validity that it makes Western powers blush.

But the executioners also show solidarity in their warlike policy.

Every year at the UN, Cuba receives almost unanimous support from the international community to demand that the United States lift the economic, commercial and financial blockade. Only the US and Israel vote against.

In its planned genocide, the US acts as Israel's older brother and protector in the UN Security Council, giving it military, political and economic cover.

 Furthermore, the Zionist lobby in the US is so powerful that it conditions the internal politics of the North American country, as does the Cuban-American mafia in Miami, blurring who is hostage to whom, or even showing perverse complicity.

On the other hand, Cuba and Palestine also receive global solidarity in the face of the barbarity of the US and Israel.

There are numerous actions organized each year by solidarity organizations with Cuba and Palestine, despite being stigmatized or silenced by the corporate press. This is not the first time that associations supporting the Palestinian people are designated by the State of Israel as terrorists, such as Cuba, included in a perverse and spurious list drawn up by the US of countries that sponsor this scourge. Tremendous hypocrisy of these governments that do sponsor and finance terrorism, as Cuba suffered since the triumph of the revolution in 1959, with 3,478 fatalities and 2,099 people injured, and as Palestine suffers today, in the penultimate intervention. Zionist military, which totals several thousand murdered, most of them minor civilians.

Aqsa was burned. The fire immediately consumed prayer mats, Al-Quran manuscripts, the roof of the mosque and several wooden parts of the mosque. One of the things that also burned was the pulpit which was made in 1187 and placed in Al Aqsa by the leader and hero of the Muslim community, Salahuddin Al Ayyubi, the liberator and opener of Al Quds in the same year after defeating the crusaders led by Richard I (The Lionheart). from England after ruling there for almost a century.

The perpetrator of the arson was someone from Australia named Dennis Michael Rohan who was fully supported by other Israeli Zionist settlers there. Local Muslims tried to extinguish the fire. However, this effort was blocked by the Israeli Zionist army.

Dennis Michael Rohan was arrested two days later on August 23, 1969. However, he was released on the grounds of mental disorder.

What is more 'interesting' is the statement by Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir (the only female PM) at the time of the fire at the Al Aqsa Mosque. He admitted that he could not sleep because he was afraid that surrounding Arab countries and the Islamic world would attack Israel as a form of resistance to the burning of the Al Aqsa Mosque and also the defeat of the Six Day War in 1967, two years earlier. However, the next day nothing happened.

Golda Meir's statement emerged which was immortalized in historical records which should have been a harsh slap to the Arab countries and the Islamic world:

“I couldn't sleep the day Al Aqsa burned down. And I thought that day Israel would be destroyed. But when I met the morning, it turned out that it was the Arabs and Muslims who were asleep.""

1720316661905916268,"🤡 Western journalists suddenly noticed the transformation of Gaza into a “children’s cemetery”

The Washington Post interviewed doctors and experts and concluded that the IDF is killing thousands of Palestinian children in Gaza. Journalists said that thanks to the Israeli army, the area has become like a “children’s cemetery.”

🤯 The newspaper notes that according to official data from the Ministry of Health of the Gaza Strip alone, more than 3.7 thousand children have died since the start of the conflict, and according to Save the Children, two out of five civilian deaths in Gaza are due to children.

 💬 “We are now in a situation where a child is killed every 10 minutes. Gaza becomes a children's cemetery. For everyone, it’s real hell,” said the WP interlocutors.

Surprisingly, less than a month passed before American journalists finally called attention to the IDF's war crimes. As Biden assiduously drags his own reputation through the mud by wholeheartedly supporting the bombing of Gaza, the global community – even one that was not initially in favor of Palestine – is now slowly boiling over.

1719792338791231559,"I visited Israel/Palestine in 2008. Tel Aviv, West Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, Galilee, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the West Bank city Qalqilya. The country is breathtakingly beautiful, of immeasurable historic value. There are so many amazing people, on all “sides” of this conflict, living on this tiny strip of land. But the visit left me genuinely traumatized. There was no doubt that there had been a war going on for generations, which had hardened into a system of occupation and oppression.

I was in East Jerusalem (which was then “Palestinian” territory) on Israel’s Independence Day. I watched packs of young IDF soldiers parade through the streets, automatic weapons out, fingers on triggers, singing nationalist songs. Palestinian shopkeepers shuttered their shops in fear of being killed or robbed (soldiers were known to just bulldoze through stores, taking whatever they wanted). Many Palestinian shopkeepers had pictures in their shops of relatives, including children, who had been killed in the conflict. The marching IDF soldiers were accompanied by plain-clothes Israelis also carrying automatic weapons, also fingers on triggers. You couldn’t tell if these people were cops, undercover military, or just ordinary people. There was a sense that violence could erupt at any moment. This set the tone for the rest of the trip.

I saw that Palestinian life was mired by a network of checkpoints and ID requirements that in effect ground social and economic life to a halt. If you were a Palestinian living in the West Bank, you needed a Jerusalem ID card to go to that city, which was probably only 30 minutes or an hour away from where you lived. If you were Palestinian and out of the country for more than 45 days, the Israeli government could simply revoke your Palestinian ID card, meaning you couldn’t get back in your own country (and you weren’t a citizen of Israel anyway). For this reason, many Palestinians were afraid to travel. Palestinian students couldn’t attend Israeli Universities. About 20% of Palestinians and 40% of Palestinian men had been in prison, and almost all of those imprisoned (90-95%) had been tortured. 

Palestinians had to wait in hours-long lines to pass through checkpoints to go to work or to the hospital. They could be turned away for any reason, which meant they would not be able to work or get medical treatment that day. Pregnant women were often forced to give birth in cars or on the road because they couldn’t get through checkpoints in time. People regularly died waiting in checkpoints. The road system was also segregated: some roads were for Jewish people only. Unless they were settlers in specific communities, most Jewish Israelis were not allowed to go to the West Bank or Gaza to see the effects of the occupation themselves. The “separation fence,” ostensibly meant to separate Israel from the Palestinian Territories, also cut many Palestinian towns in half, forcing families and neighbors to go through an arduous checkpoint process just to see one another. In the West Bank city of Qalqilya, my friends and I saw an above-ground sewer that had had bars placed on the openings, so that people couldn’t even use the sewers to quickly get to hospital, which was in a different city. 

In the Palestinian village of Nazareth, where Jesus is believed to have grown up, my friends and I visited beautiful churches. We spoke with many ordinary Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian. I bought a bottle of the olive oil made in the town—it tasted exquisite. “You have to help us,” said the woman selling me the olive oil, pleading with her eyes.

1720263460074950866,"Biden ‘Countering Islamophobia’ While Incinerating Gaza Is The Most Democrat Thing Ever

In what is arguably the most liberal thing ever to have happened in all of human history, the Biden administration has announced its plans to develop a US National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia even as it helps Israel massacre Muslims by the thousands in Gaza.

“For too long, Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents,” reads a White House statement on the announcement. “We all mourn the recent barbaric killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy, and the brutal attack on his mother in their home outside Chicago.”

This comes as the death toll from the US-backed bombing campaign in Gaza nears 10,000, including 3,760 children, in what experts and authorities around the world are describing with increasing frequency as a genocide. If these people were Jewish instead of Muslim, they would not be trapped in a giant concentration camp while the IDF hammers them with a nonstop barrage of military explosives, but because of their ethnicity they are subjected to this horror.

There’s a classic meme which makes fun of the way US foreign policy under Democrats is the same murderous foreign policy as it is under Republicans, but with a bunch of woke-sounding bumper stickers slapped on the surface to make it palatable for progressive sensibilities:

Can you think of a better illustration of the dynamic that’s highlighted by this criticism than what we’re seeing from the Biden administration today? This is after all the same administration whose Department of Defense recently said they are putting zero limits on what Israel may or may not do with the weapons it’s being given by the United States.

“We are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that is provided,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told the press on Monday. “That is really up to the Israel Defense Force to use in how they are going to conduct their operations. But we’re not putting any constraints on that.”

As In These Times reports, this same administration is also trying to get permission to conduct arms deals with Israel without congressional supervision, in complete secrecy and without accountability to the voting public.

The US government is every bit as culpable in the massacre of thousands of Muslim children as Israel, because this entire massacre is happening with both its assistance and its express permission. But here is its government pretending to care deeply that one Muslim child was killed by an Islamophobic psycho in America.

This is everything that’s disgusting about the Democratic Party. It puts a warm, friendly face on the most murderous and tyrannical power structure on earth, posing as a defender of marginalized groups while dropping bombs on the most marginalized populations on this planet. It selects a high number of women and racially diverse officials for its cabinet positions to convey the illusion that it has transcended the abusive bigotries of the past, while subjecting impoverished brown-skinned foreigners to a nonstop barrage of high-tech explosive munitions in massacres that would be the envy of the worst white supremacist imperialists in history.

A much more accurate image for the United States than the one it tries to give itself with its fraudulent progressive virtue signalling would be the one it was given by protesters who interrupted Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday. Demonstrators painted their hands red to show the blood this administration has on its own hands, resulting in viral images of Blinken’s face surrounded by bloody hands circulating all over the internet.

That’s what the US empire really is. Not the liberal bastion of human rights it presents itself as, but a blood-spattered psychopathic murder machine which maintains its domination of this planet with the nonstop butchery of human beings.

The longer the massacre in Gaza goes on, the more people are catching a glimpse behind the plastic smiley-faced mask of the US empire and seeing the cold-eyed killer underneath.",Gaza,negative

And yet none of her reporting highlighted comments made to the Israeli Haaretz newspaper by Tuval Escapa, the kibbutz’s security coordinator. He said Israeli military commanders had ordered the “shelling [of] houses on their occupants in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the [Israeli] hostages”.

Nor did Williamson refer to the testimony of Yasmin Porat, who sought shelter in Be’eri from the nearby Nova music festival. Porat told Israeli Radio that once Israeli special forces arrived: “They eliminated everyone, including the [Israeli] hostages because there was very, very heavy crossfire.”

Are the images of charred bodies presented by the BBC, accompanied by a warning of their graphic, upsetting nature, incontrovertible proof that Hamas behaved like monsters, bent on the most twisted kind of vengeance?

Or might those blackened remains be evidence that Israeli civilians and Hamas fighters burned alongside each other, after they were engulfed in flames caused by Israeli shelling of the houses?

Jews had already been living in the Holy Land for centuries. The anti-Zionist and anti-Israeli Jewish community living in Jerusalem Meah Shearim are Palestinian Jews who lived here during the time of the Islamic states.

Anti-Zionist Jews lived in peace and harmony with their Muslim neighbors before the establishment of Israel.

In fact, Jews and Muslims here would take care of each other's children and entrust their children to each other.

Anti-Zionist Torah Jews did not usurp anyone's lands or confiscate their homes like the Zionists.

In fact, Rabbi Moshe Hirsch, who served as the minister of the Palestinian state and was responsible for the Jews, took part in the Palestinian government.

Know well that anti-Zionist Torah Jews do not accept any aid from the Israeli government.

I understand all of this up to a point, but when the people we call ""our"" dismiss the prayers and say ""it can't be done with prayers"", that's where I go crazy.

It can't be done with anything other than prayer, sir! If you don't have prayer, you are nothing, you are void, you are null and void.

There is no war for us that can be won by those whose minds are not Muslim. Our Lord can answer the prayer of an oppressed, a patient, or a hurt person at any time. With that prayer, the Zionist's eyes may not be able to see, his hands may not be able to hold, and his ears may not be able to hear.

There is no war that those who do not believe in this can win.

We will try. We will continue to throw stones at the enemy. The stone was small, but it was big, what a shame. Ant, Hz. He carried water in his mouth to extinguish the fire prepared to burn Abraham.

1720166981452607925,"For the first time in history, a Speaker of the House has taken a position that he will not support aid to Israel unless there are conditions.  It represents the first time in history that a House Speaker has all but endorsed conditioning aid to Israel.  This is a dangerous precedent that cannot be allowed to stand.  

When I ran for Congress, I made it crystal clear that I would oppose anything other than unconditional aid to Israel—whether the attempts at  conditioning come from the far left or from the far right.  

The cheap cynical game that Speaker Johnson is playing sets a dangerous precedent for conditioning emergency aid. It represents a dangerous politicizing of Israel in a time of war.  It represents a dangerous decision to pursue division over unity and politics over principle.  

The House should vote on a clean bill, with no poison pills, that would send an overwhelmingly bipartisan message of unconditional unity around Israel.  Our ally deserves nothing less in its moment of greatest need. 

The Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas want nothing more than for the House to be dysfunctional, divided and distracted. Choosing gamesmanship over statesmanship, as Speaker Johnson has elected to do, will contribute to the further erosion of US-Israeli deterrence against common enemies. 

What is the point of voting on a cynically conceived bill that is dead on arrival in the Senate and that would be vetoed by the most the pro-Israel wartime President in history—the ONLY President to travel to Israel in a time of war?  

Speaker’s Johnson’s bill would have the real-world effect of not delivering aid to Israel immediately but of delaying it indefinitely.  This, to me, is as shameful as it is senseless.",Israel,neutral

Listen to him, please listen to Palestinian voices.

➖“The most difficult thing is when you have to write the number of an unknown baby, “unknown baby 75”, “unknown baby 77” 💔.. This because these children arrive at the hospital most of the time without a mother no father or family who can speak for them and identify them!

It broke me to see the two children in the background (may الله azzawajal soothe the victims' ills), and to know that they lack supplies.. May الله azzawajal ensure their sustenance, آمين!

I ask you one thing out of pure human kindness: do not choose to ignore all of this, honor his speech to the whole world and act by being their voice, denouncing, making noise and praying for deliverance and a ceasefire.

Let’s not just listen to him, let’s hear him, honoring his request:

“Please save Gaza.
If you're human, please stop this.""

 Austin promised that Washington would point out to allies “the need to take into account civilian populations in combat zones.”

This is the title of a column in Al Arab Daily, owned by the United Emirates.

This column explains why organs such as Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood network are common enemies of Arab countries.

Why are Hamas in Palestine, the Brotherhood in Egypt, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen, becoming thorns in the flesh of Arab countries.

Because their sectarian agenda (caliphate) threatens the nation state.

Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was killed by pro-Brotherhood soldiers. Hezbollah destroyed Lebanon as a nation state. Likewise the Houthis in Yemen. And Hamas in Gaza.

These groups have an interest in continuing to wage religious war. The aim is to drag regional countries into prolonged conflict. Tear down the boundaries of nation states.

H: Who occupied what?

MF: Jews occupied Israel - the land of Muslims - Palestine.

H: But Israel is land of Jews.

MF: Haha fake news. There was nothing known as Israel before 1948. US & west conspired against Muslims and occupied our land.

H: But Allah Herself calls Jews as ""children of Israel"" at least 40 times in Quran. If Israel didn't exist before 1948, was Quran written in 1949? Or is Quran wrong?

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: Still, Jews are occupiers of Muslim land of Palestine.

H: But there's no mention of word/ place called Palestine in Allah's book. So it's Muslims who must explain what they did to original Israel & its children mentioned in Quran that they were out of their land for 1400 yrs. If one party that's occupier here, it's Muslims, not the Jews.

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: Can't you see little kids in Gaza dying in Israeli attacks?

H: I also saw little Israeli children
K!lled by Islamists of Hamas. Islamists started it.

MF: 

H: Why silent?

MF: Innocent Muslims are dying.

H: Ok tell me, if Israel hadn't k!lled any Muslim in Palestine/ Gaza, would Allah have granted them Jannat? In holy book and Hadith, isn't it written that before Islamic judgement day, Muslims will k!ll all Jews and even stones & trees will help Muslims in the genocide? Even if Israel does nothing, their slaughter is certain?

MF: No Jew/ Hindu/ non-Muslim can get Jannat. Yes, k!lling of Jews before Qayamat is mentioned in our books. So what? That's Allah's word. But why are Jews k!lling innocent Muslims now?

H: So Jews should wait for the day when they get slaughtered by zombies and till then they must embrace you as brothers? And even after getting slaughtered, they'll be burned in eternal Islamic hell. Why shouldn't Jews defend themselves and preempt future slaughter today?

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: You're a typical Hindutva genocide enabler.

H: And who are you?

MF: I am a proud patriotic Indian Muslim who rejected Pakistan in 1947.

H: So your ancestors were children of India?

MF: Haha, lol, Hindu! My ancestors came to India with Mahmud Ghaznavi riding donkeys. We Muslims conquered & ruled you for 1000 yrs.

H: So you're an outsider in India. Why shouldn't India throw you out, as, in your own words- ""occupiers are to be thrown out by all means""? Why shouldn't India do to you what you want to do with 'occupiers' in Israel?

1720079085991243928,"For the first time since the war in Israel was started by a cowardly terrorist attack by Hamas, I see evidence of a Palestinian pointing the finger at who is actually responsible for all this.

""It's the Hamas dogs' fault,"" said a Palestinian woman, in pain as people died under the rubble. She quickly had her mouth covered by the hand of a person next to her, perhaps out of disagreement with what she said, perhaps fearing the retaliation she would suffer from the terrorists.

The truth is this: terrorists use the population of Gaza as cannon fodder. They install their bases in densely populated areas, to avoid Israeli attacks, and to be able to blame Israel for the deaths of civilians.

Additionally, supplies sent to civilians are diverted to their terrorist operations. A member of the group stated that they have fuel, water and food stored for 4 months. They have stolen gasoline and food sent to hospitals and refugee camps. They even went so far as to destroy a new water piping system to make rockets from the pipes.

Last week, a Hamas leader responded to an Arab journalist who asked why the group did not open its tunnels to the population to protect themselves against bombings, saying that the tunnels were for the exclusive use of terrorists.

When Israel ordered the evacuation of the northern sector of Gaza, Hamas militias dynamited roads and even shot at civilians who tried to leave the area, demanding that they stay, exposing people to shelling.

Hamas has installed an obscurantist dictatorship in Gaza, which follows Sharia, the Islamic law that provides for the death penalty for homosexuals, and the treatment of women as second-class citizens, to name just two examples. There is no freedom of expression, there is no popular representation, there is no free press. The opposition is shot at.

We established a special unit for tunnels. There is a special unit that controls the system and ensures all circulation, logistics and security.

Every network has an alternative. of Israel
The biggest goal is to gain information about this network. But they have zero chance of deciphering the underground network.

ISRAEL WAS PLANNING A MAJOR ATTACK

There was very serious preparation in the invisible part of this operation. Israel can never forget this defeat.

Of course, we made calculations about Israeli brutality. However, the world should know that Israel would launch a major attack on Gaza right after these holidays. They fell into the trap. Now, on the one hand, they are bombing Gaza, and on the other hand, they are fighting among themselves.

We created the game entirely ourselves. We even ensured that misleading messages about the situation in Gaza reached Mossad. We put the Israeli intelligence and army to sleep. That night was the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. Before the celebrations, the Internal Intelligence Unit (Şabak) and Mossad prepared a report. It was reported that the security of the division stationed in Tel Aviv, Gaza and the border is stronger than ever.

Because of this report, the army members drank and indulged in debauchery all night long. We caught them off guard. 1,200 young people dispersed the 12 thousand-strong Zionist division. We blindsided them from every angle. We paralyzed all their electronic systems. Our hackers crashed their systems.

We inflicted a historical defeat on them.

That day and afterwards we fought only with soldiers. We did not kill civilians. Unfortunately, since 1948, we have been fighting not only with Israel, but also with their lackeys.

Unfortunately, we could not see Erdoğan's stance in the Islamic world and Arab countries, with a few exceptions. Even if they kill every single one of us, we will not give up on the Palestinian cause. We will not betray the trust of Sultan Abdulhamid..

They have lived there since the 2014 ISIS genocide. 

Instead, they’d have an autonomous government in Iraq's Sinjar region, their indigenous land. And they’d be thriving as a community as they’d spend their resources on the improvement of their society and governance. 

This stands in contrast to Hamas terrorists, who spend every single penny they find to build their war machine in dreams of one day destroying Israel.

If the world supported Yazidis just a little bit, they’d be a success story in the Middle East as they’re a peace-loving, civilized and capable community dedicated to the philosophy of “live and let live”.

Hamas, however, despite all the support they get from millions of useful idiots across the world, are doomed to cease to exist and go down in history as the genocidal terrorist scum of the earth.",Gaza,positive

- Hamas is a religious, fundamentalist, extremist terrorist group committed to Israel's destruction and condemns other Arab Muslim nations for making peace with the Jewish State

- 750K Palestinians & 800K Jews were uprooted from across MENA after 1947. Some were expelled, others left voluntarily. The Jews were resettled as citizens of Israel. The Palestinians have been kept as political pawns by the Arab nations, and enabled by UNRWA. 

- Jews have lived in Jerusalem uninterrupted for 3,000 years. Archaeological evidence proves this. They did not create Israel ""for their safety."" They realized a 3,000 year old dream to re-establish (and decolonize) their ancient homeland.

- Your article implies that Israel has started many wars since 1948. That's patently false. In almost every case, Israel was attacked pre-emptively and successfully defended herself. 

- Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt, respectively. Both countries gave up their claims to the land. We can only guess that the 1947 designation @SkyNews is referring to is the partition plan that the Arab population rejected. 

- Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, not an occupied city. Israel's presence in the West Bank is governed by the Oslo Accords, since the Palestinian leadership continues to reject offers to conclude a final peace that would result in an independent Palestinian State.

1720069600308580601,"What the BBC fails to tell us about October 7:

Consider the stark contrast in the western media’s treatment of events on October 7 and its treatment of the strike on the car park at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza on October 17, in which hundreds of Palestinians were reported killed.

In the case of Al-Ahli, the media were only too ready to cast aside all the evidence that the hospital had been hit by an Israeli strike, immediately Israel contested the claim. Instead journalists hurriedly amplified Israel’s counter-allegation that a Palestinian rocket had fallen on the hospital. Most of the media moved on after concluding “The truth may never be clear”, or even less credibly, that Palestinian militants were the most likely culprits.

In telling contrast, the western media have not been willing to raise even a single question about what happened on October 7. They have enthusiastically attributed every horror that day to Hamas. They have ignored the reality of utter chaos that reigned for many hours and the potential for poor, desperate and morally dubious decision-making by the Israeli military.

In fact, the media have gone much further. In advancing the narrative of “Hamas as savages”, they have promoted obvious fictions, such as the story that “Hamas beheaded 40 babies”. That piece of fake news was even taken up briefly by US President Joe Biden, before it was quietly walked back by his officials.

Similarly, it is still a popular throwaway line among the western commentariat that “Hamas carried out rapes”, though once again the allegation is evidence-free so far.

We should be clear. If Israel had serious evidence for either of these claims, it would be aggressively promoting it. Instead, it is doing the next best thing: letting innuendo gently sink into the audience’s subconscious, settling there as a prejudice that cannot be interrogated.

Once again, Éric Zemmour was right. In a press release sent to Muslims, the rector corrects his remarks and explains himself. ⤵️

-------------

Press release from the Rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris Chemseddine Hafiz in reaction to the criticism addressed to him following his appearance on BFM TV in the company of the Chief Rabbi of France Haim Korsia:

Dear brothers and sisters, may the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you,

Weeks before our meeting on October 7, the Council of Hopes was the target of attacks, defamation, or attempts at destabilization. And it continues. However, praised be Allah, our project and our council remain united, solid and high... and our brotherhood is growing stronger and stronger.
This time, I am the target of a false campaign, led by shady parties, motivated by shameful score-settling and conspiracies aimed at tarnishing the image of the Grand Mosque of Paris and defaming me. The respect I have for each of you compels me to explain what is happening.

First of all, I participated with the Chief Rabbi of France last Thursday in a French television program called ""L'Appel à la Paix"". My objective in participating in this program was to convince public opinion and French politicians of the urgent need for peace in Gaza, for an immediate stop to the shooting, to put an end to the deadly bombings on this martyr city, to protect all civilians, to ensure access to humanitarian aid in Gaza, to lift the siege, and finally, to establish a Palestinian state in the full meaning of the word, allowing the courageous Palestinian people to live in security.

Second, I have never commented on the terrorist nature of Hamas or not. (This means that I never said that Hamas was a terrorist movement, nor the opposite)... I said that it would be unfair to say that the Palestinian people are terrorists. What was important to me was to defend the innocent victims, the majority of whom are children and women, due to a new deadly Israeli aggression, adding to other attacks perpetrated in the past.

But the danger this time is greater, because this new war could lead to ethnic cleansing and the complete displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, with tens of thousands of deaths.

We cannot help our brothers in Palestine with emotional speeches or rhetorical one-upmanship. We must know how to address the public with reason and composure. Europeans must see that we are calm, even if we are angry and revolted. We must know how to make our voices heard in order to change the policies of Western governments regarding the terrible suffering of the Palestinian people.

Third, I personally wrote the last Friday sermon, read by 150 imams of the Grand Mosque of Paris throughout France, praying to Allah to free our brothers in Gaza, to support them, and asking for justice and an end to the aggression, recalling the values ​​of Islam in these difficult times. In this sermon that I wrote, I considered the resistance of the Palestinian people as legitimate to obtain their fundamental rights. This is the position that I undertake to take into account and support before you.

But we, as leaders, want to change things profoundly in Europe, to be able to defend Muslims in Europe and elsewhere, particularly in Palestine. That's why we can't say anything.

We must be careful, above all, since October 7, political movements, and not only extremists, helped by certain intellectuals and media, have been using this date to fuel Islamophobia and hatred towards Muslims. The battle we must fight together has two aspects: overcoming fear and hatred towards Muslims in Europe and convincing public opinion of the murderous terrorism suffered by Palestinians, so that European governments act to protect Gaza and defend Palestine, in particular by applying international law.

This mission is an oath that I take before you as a man belonging to a revolutionary family who paid a heavy price during the war of liberation in Algeria... Your brother, Chemseddine Mohammed Hafiz, Rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris",Hamas,positive

❗️ Skirmishes regularly take place on the border between the countries between IDF and Hezbollah militants, although official Lebanon has stressed its reluctance to go to war. However, Tel Aviv said in mid-October that Hezbollah had decided to join Hamas and was ""paying for it.""

It is obvious that Israel will not submit to Hezbollah's ultimatum, believing that with the support of the United States, it has the strength to fight on two fronts at once. However, the chances of Algeria going to war are now greater than ever, and Iran is also preparing the ground for a military confrontation with the Israelis.

-India has sent food items to 🇵🇸
-Hamas support is visible in India

-Hamas Palestine is being strongly supported on social media.

-India's ruling opposition is supporting Palestine
-Why has India not provided any official help to Israel till now?

-Now only a few Hindus are left who are still supporting Israel against terrorism, but tell me one thing Hindus that how will you be able to work against your government.

- Here the double drum of Hindus is being beaten, because the Muslims of India are also harassing the Hindus on social media, on the other hand, the Indian government is also not going in favor of Israel?

-In this situation, why should we reach a decision and take evil?

-Who is with Israel in this country and why not?
-Will anyone support India in future?
-Israel has stood with India in every trouble.

-Muslims of India should also have protested against the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel, whereas on the contrary today they are supporting Hamas and sharing fake videos and photos of Hamas, why?

-When the Indian government has protested against the October 7 attack on Israel, then why are the Muslims of India not with the government of their country?
-Are you not against terrorism?
-Do you support the terrorist attack of October 7?
-Will you go against your country?

This is MAJOR.

We were first to report 2 days ago that Hezbollah/Iran warned Israel through the U.S that Hezbollah will join if there is no ceasefire, or at least plans for a ceasefire (see tweet below)

This started materializing in the past few hours, as:

1. Hezbollah received weapons and reinforcements from Syria

2. An Iraqi proxy warned Israel and launched a drone against Israel (very symbolic, as it was from Iraq) 

3. Syria began preparing for a regional war (leaked documents)

Well, a few hours ago, we also reported of a potential 'temporary truce' between Israel and Hamas, again proving the accuracy of our initial report. 

This was the first piece of good news received in days.

WHAT'S NEXT?

In a few hours, Hezbollah's leader will be giving a highly anticipated speech that we will be streaming and analyzing.

My prediction is that, if no truce deal is reached, and Israel continues with the current strategy, Hezbollah will enter the war.

STATEMENT REFERENCED ABOVE:

Here's the statement by the Ebrahim Valipour, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Islamic Republic of Iran, Director of Department of Palestine and Jordan:

""From tomorrow, the Zionist regime's cabinet will have to accept a ground withdrawal from the Gaza region and accelerate the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

In october 29, 1956 Israel was a military regime. It put a curfew on Palestinian villages(who has citizenship) at 9pm, including Kafr Qassem. But on this day, the curfew was moved to 5pm. This decision was taken at 1pm, the mayor of Kofr Qassem was told at 4.30pm. 

Hundreds of Palestinian workers were out in fields, unaware of the curfew. The Israeli border guard made no effort to tell the workers, what did the IDF commander Isaachar Shadmi say about Palestinians out past curfew? “I don’t want sentimentality; i don’t want detainees”.

When asked to clarify his words, he said: “may God have mercy on them”, he ordered to indiscriminately kill every Palestinian out past curfew.

In a truck…on their way home from the fields..47 Palestinian citizens were stopped by the Israeli border guard, they were lined up and shot dead.

Israel imposed a two month ban on media reporting on the crime,after outrage, protest and global pressure, 11 soldiers were put on trial and 8 were convicted, Israel tried to evade the crime by setting up mock trials for the soldiers, they were sentenced to 15-17 years in prison, then it was reduced until all soldiers were released.

But the worst part is Isaachar Shadmi’s trial. Shadami was acquitted, he was only found guilty of exceeding his authority in extending curfew, he walked free, only having to pay symbolic $ 0.01

When the bombing intensified, she sat with the whole family in the corner of a dark room, pale with terror, praying and repeating, “Allah is sufficient for us and the best of those on whom to depend.”

""The 2,000 young people who stormed the gates of Gaza on October 7, 2023 had been born in a concentration camp. For two decades they had been locked in a strip of land 40 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide that was between the most densely populated places in the world.

The vast majority of them could never hope to go out but only walk every day along the suffocating perimeter of the field; never aspire to gainful employment or to eat a full meal; Never expect to get married or start a family. Abandoned by all, they were “remained” to languish and die.

To accelerate this process, Israel periodically launched “operations” that caused death and destruction in Gaza: thousands of people were methodically gunned down; homes and critical infrastructure systematically pulverized.

It may sound like the script of a bad B movie, but on the night of October 6, each of those 2,000 men probably kissed his mother and then his father goodbye. Forever. And then each of them silently vowed to vindicate the relentless torture of a twilight existence and avenge the murder of a grandfather, a sister, a brother, a niece and a nephew by that satanic power that cursed their lives.""

1720315434128572659,"Why Didn't God Immediately Destroy Israel?

By Anwar Hudijono, senior journalist living in Sidoarjo.

PWMU.CO – Aggrieved at seeing Israel's atrocities against the Palestinian people, he finally blurted out, ""Why did God let the Zionists run rampant? Why don't you just clamp it? Isn't God just and mighty?”

Such questions are only natural for lay people. But it will be different when we look at the essence of life that has been shaped by God.

In God's blueprint, victory or glory and defeat or adversity are rotated between humans.

And those times (of glory and destruction), We passed among mankind (so that they might learn a lesson), and that Allah might distinguish those who believe (from those who disbelieve) and that He may make some of you (fall as) martyrs. And Allah does not like unjust people."" (Ali 'Imran 140)

The purpose of the rotation is to differentiate between those who are disbelievers and those who are believers. Who is just and who is unjust. And opens up opportunities for martyrdom.

Apart from that, it is to cleanse the sins of believers. Suffering, illness, hunger, colonization, persecution are God's ways of cleansing their sins. Even a needle stick can wash away sins.

Also the way Allah wants to destroy the infidels.

""And that Allah may cleanse those who believe (from their sins) and destroy those who disbelieve."" (Ali 'Imran 3 141)

During this period, opportunities for jihad and patience are also opened, both of which are the way to heaven.

""Do you think that you will enter Paradise, even though Allah has not yet revealed those who strive among you, and those who are patient have not yet appeared?"" (Ali 'Imran 3 142)

""(while saying), ""Good luck to you because of your patience."" So how delicious is that final place."" (ar-Ra'd 24)

The road to heaven now stretches wide in Gaza. Jihad takes up arms, helps others, carries out diplomacy against oppression (fasad). Of course, you have to be patient in facing repeated tests, starting from hunger, humiliation, illness and even death. Currently, no one has more patience than the people of Gaza.

So in the concept of rotation, currently the people of Gaza, who are predominantly Muslim, are in a losing position. Meanwhile, the Jews are in a winning position after more than 2000 years of decline.

In this position of victory or victory, the Jews have acted in a fake, unjust and reckless manner. And will definitely receive God's punishment for his actions. That has been God's provision which has been proven over and over again in human history. Remember Pharaoh, Namrud, the people of Ad, Thamud.

""And you cannot escape at all (from Allah's punishment) neither on earth nor in heaven, and there is no protector and helper for you besides Allah.""
(al-'Ankabut 22)

When did it happen? We don't know exactly. It could happen suddenly, such as if God personally intervened to punish His enemies.

Look, Pharaoh certainly never expected that he would be swallowed by the waves. Prophet Lut's people never anticipated that it would rain stones and the earth would turn over while people were fast asleep.

""So as for the people of Samud, they were destroyed with a very loud noise."" (al-Haqqah 5)

""As for the people of `Ad, they were destroyed by a very cold hurricane."" (al-Haqqah 6)

""And (there are) other gifts that you like (namely) help from Allah and victory that is near (time). And convey good news to the believers."" (as-Saff 13)

Let's wait while we pray. Rabbi a'lam

As, moreover, you only ask for a ceasefire by addressing Israel, which you seek to pass off as a criminal state by constantly brandishing images of Israeli strikes on Gaza, you cannot ignore that if Israel ceases to defend itself, it will also cease to exist in the hours and days that follow.
The situation is certainly difficult, and I myself, who do not abandon my critical spirit and who am entirely ready to admit a part of responsibility on the Israeli side in this situation which has become inextricable, I say clearly what is, without hatred nor bias: the existence of Israel and the survival of its population requires those who lead this country not to let down their guard and to definitively neutralize Hamas, which is also determined to put an end to it.

1720182775758684441,"I actually have more respect for Islamists than liberal lefties. Islamists say what they mean and they mean what they say. When they say ""from the river to the sea"" they really do mean the destruction of Israel and the eradication of the Jews. Lefties, however, pretend it means something else.

As far as I can discern, lefties believe the state of Israel should be abolished because it's a ""racist, ethnonationalist, apartheid abomination"". But unlike Islamists, and because lefties never think through the consequences of what they say, they actually believe what replaces Israel will be a peaceful, progressive, secular state where Jews, Muslims and Christians all rub along nicely. This is their ""one state solution"". 

But we don't have to speculate what would actually happen. We have a living example of this exact dynamic emerging in real-time. Think South Africa.

South Africa was an actual racist, apartheid state. But it was also a functioning country. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending apartheid, but what we've seen since is the rise of grievance politics (Marxism in a racial justice shroud) which, left unchecked, will see ethnic cleansing of whites from South Africa, the confiscation of their farms. On a long enough timeline, the water, telecoms and energy system will completely collapse under the weight of the corruption. The black factions will split, and split again, and then turn on each other, and then there's be a bloodbath and a famine in which millions die. We've seen this repeated across Africa where breadbaskets turn to basket cases. 

So imagine then what happens if the world decides to delegitimise Israel, the UN revokes recognition and the US stops supplying arms. In all probability Arab militias from neighbouring countries will move in, and they'll get to work cleansing the entire region of Jews. And when they're done with Jews, they'll go after the Christians and anyone else who isn't Muslim. And when they're done, they'll turn on each other. They probably won't even wait that long. Arabs hate Palestinians and Palestinians (being of diverse origins) tend to hate each other. Bedouins are viewed as the regions Roma. (Israeli Bedouins are safer under Israeli rule). 

Israel as it stands is a largely functioning country and the closest the region has ever got to a liberal democracy but what replaces it will not be a unified state of Palestine for Palestinians. It will be yet another corrupt Arab slum, where everything the Israelis built will be destroyed. The farms, the universities, the factories, the laboratories, the roads... will all be looted and left to fall into decay. Essentially a hybrid of Afghanistan/Libya and Lebanon. 

There are some on the right who say the Israeli-Palestine issue is none of our business, but Europe cannot afford this to happen. Israel's survival is very much in our interests. We saw waves of mass immigration at the height of the Syrian civil war, and we'd likely see similar. Half of Gaza would depart for Europe. That's the great irony of the Palestinian struggle. If they they had it their way, they wouldn't even want to live there. Israel is only a functioning and prosperous place because Israelis are nation builders. 

Arabs have never shown any such initiative in building the foundations of a Palestinian state. They embezzle aid, they destroy infrastructure, and blame Israel for their every failing. In all probability, the Palestinian state would rapidly descend into a state of civil war, probably destabilising Jordan in the process, resulting in a Jordanian civil war where the Hashemites brutalise Palestinians in a way the world has never seen. For a region that has been in a state of low grade war since before I was born, we would end up looking at the Israel era as a time of relative peace.

Lefties and Palestinians reject a two state solution because they ultimately want to abolish Israel. Israel rejects a two state solution because they know there is no genuine desire for one - and no observable efforts to build one. So a one state solution is the only solution on the table. 

So the question is, is it going to be a Jewish state where Jews can live in peace and safety, with at least some rights for Palestinians (better than Jews would have were the situation reversed), or one where Jews and Christians are massacred, that rapidly devolves into anarchy and destitution? If it's the former, then the fastest route to the best normal we will ever get, is the eradication of Hamas. If it's the latter, please just drop the pretense that this is about human rights and international law. Just admit you hate Jews.",Israel,negative
