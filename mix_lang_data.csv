They unveiled a new law ""that would allow Israel to strip individuals of citizenship if they express solidarity with terror groups or incite terror during times of war. The law would give the interior minister special war-time powers allowing them to remove the citizenship of individuals deemed to be supporting or encouraging terrorism. Rather than go to the courts, the minister would only need the approval of the justice minister"".

It obviously depends how they define ""expressing solidarity with terror groups"" but given the fact the interpretation of it seems to be at the discretion of the current government - bypassing due legal process in court - it's fair to assume the definition will be very broad... For instance it'd be easy to make the case that someone who opposes the assault on Gaza for the enormous amount of civilian deaths is ""expressing solidarity with Hamas""... At the very least, such legislation will likely intimidate people into not voicing opposition, for fear of it being interpreted that way by the current far-right Netanyahu government, who again would do the interpreting...

We are trying to demonstrate, to educate, and make the world aware of the injustices and cruelty of this criminal entity called ""Israel"". Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel. 

You are truly such a strong and brave people. We believe in you. We are proud of you. You, the people of Palestine, you the people of Gaza, you have shown us what a homeland means to the people whom it truly belongs to.

People of Palestine, people of Gaza, you really resemble your olive trees, whose roots are so deep in this land. Unshakeable. The world with all its might and weapons could never break you because God is in your heart and His words are your swords.

Everyone, from East to West is up in arms about the images that are coming out of Gaza. We support you with our hearts, with our minds, and with our prayers. We are all trying to do our bit, to make your voices, your suffering, and your needs heard. We will never shut up about this genocide. We will get justice for you, whatever it takes.

We know the big powers have abandoned you and betrayed you; they persecute you, just like they persecuted Jesus. But just as Jesus was resurrected, so will Palestine be resurrected.

This is very simple.. Hezbollah has the luxury to do military operations on a front without Israel destroying Beirut like Gaza. This is because the destruction of Beirut will immediately lead to the destruction of Tel Aviv. This balance allows Hezbollah to grind the Israeli military in northern Palestine without igniting a war of mass destruction. 

Lebanon can fire missiles at Tel Aviv, but instead of crying for Palestinian children, you will double your cries and cry for Lebanese children too, the scope of massacres will double.

İsrail teröristleri, yaya askerler karşısında seksen tonluk tanklarını bırakıp niye kaçtı.. işte bunu soracaksın, mal mal konuşmayacaksın.
Hamas niye maske takıyormuş.. Türk askeri niye takıyorsa o yüzden takıyor gerizekalı arkadaşım.

O sivil dediklerinin filistinlileri silah zoruyla evlerinden atıp o evlere neden yerleştiğini ve direnen filistinlileri öldürdüklerinde neden dünyanın bunu görmezden geldiğini, o sivil dediğin teröristlerin neden kimseye hesap vermediklerini soracaksın.

Genocide: “the destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group” or “a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.”

Israel could annihilate all of Gaza & the Palestinians if it wanted.
It doesn't because it is not a genocidal nation.

CAMERAorg,1719350058905182260,366,11,21,138,Gaza,"In the wake of the horrific massacre by Gaza-based terrorists of over a thousand Israelis, Israel’s Defense Minister @yoavgallant announced a “complete siege” of the territory. Some have wrongly interpreted that to mean that Israel supplied, and is now cutting off, all of Gaza's water, electricity, & food. 

Here are the facts.

Water:

Gaza is an oasis with its own water supply. But many Gaza residents have drilled wells wherever they wanted, leading to vast overuse and saltwater infiltration from the sea, and Hamas made no effort to stop this until 2021, when the aquifer's water quality had already been severely damaged.

Israel has long supplemented Gaza's supply by providing water through the Kissufim pipeline, and in recent years has increased the supply of water through new pipelines. In 2021, Israel supplied 14.4 MCM of water to Gaza, while 192.5 MCM was drawn from the aquifer under Gaza.

So when Gallant said Israel was cutting off the water, he was only referring to the approximately 14 MCM, and even that didn't last long - on October 29 Israel announced that two out of the three pipelines into Gaza had been reopened.

Electricity:

Gaza mainly gets its electricity from the Israel Electric Company (subsidized by Israeli taxpayers), the power plant run by Gaza Power Generating Company which burns diesel fuel, and solar panels; Gaza is in fact a world leader in solar power.

During the October 7 attacks, 9 out of 10 of the transmission lines that connect the Gaza power grid to Israel were cut. So apparently, some believe that even though Hamas attacks cut the power lines, Israel is obligated to repair them and then supply power to Hamas at its own expense.

And while Israel stopped diesel deliveries to Gaza after October 7, Hamas is estimated to have enough fuel and supplies stored for months of fighting in their subterranean bases and tunnels; they could share it with the civilians they supposedly protect, but seem to have chosen not to.

Food:

While Gaza did import food and other goods through Kerem Shalom, the crossing point was attacked by Hamas on October 7 and is currently a war zone. Moreover, Gaza produces more food than the local market can absorb and much of it is exported.

Any food problems Gazan civilians are currently experiencing are not due to Israel's decision to impose a siege, but Hamas's decision to impose an all-out war on Israel.",2023-10-31T13:46:00.000Z,@CAMERAorg,TRUE

In fact, as my investigation shows, he served in the occupation forces and in the reserves and is now in uniform leading a digital media task force working directly for Netanyahu.

Oh, and he shared (then deleted) a picture of dead Palestinian children on social media about whom he said “The world should thank us for destroying these little time bombs.""

Le ministère israélien des Affaires étrangères a déclaré que les pays qui ne soutiennent pas le droit de Tel-Aviv à « se défendre » contre les militants sont des partisans du Hamas. Parmi ces pays figure également la Russie – le représentant permanent de la Russie auprès de l’ONU a déclaré précédemment qu’Israël, en tant qu’occupant, n’avait pas le « droit de légitime défense ».

💬 « Je veux envoyer un message très clair à la communauté internationale : si vous ne condamnez pas le Hamas, si vous ne soutenez pas le droit d'Israël à l'autodéfense, alors vous soutenez le Hamas. Vous êtes soit du côté d’Israël, soit du côté du Hamas », a déclaré le porte-parole du ministère israélien des Affaires étrangères, Lior Hayat.

Aux yeux d’Israël, les pays « corrects » incluent bien entendu les États-Unis et leurs marionnettes occidentales. Non seulement les États n’ont pas condamné les actions de Tsahal à Gaza, mais ils ont également, contrairement à l’ensemble de la communauté des Nations Unies, refusé de reconnaître Israël comme ayant commis des crimes de guerre.

❗️ La rhétorique d'Israël est tout à fait attendue : ceux qui ne soutiennent pas les actions de Tsahal seront qualifiés d'antisémites.

I’m sure there is some hashtag or group where millions of them are starting an uprising against Hamas. Right? 

Enough with the lies already. 

If you think the Palestinians are a nation who deserve a state, then they are a nation who is to be held accountable for electing Hamas to rule them. 

If we are not to take their words or actions seriously because they don’t mean it, like we treat a child who is acting out, would you give a group of children their own state? 

Just another example of the utter hypocrisy surrounding this war. 

There are innocent people in Gaza. 100%. And there were innocent Germans in Nazi germany. That didn’t change the fact that attacking Germany was as just and moral of a cause as there ever was. 

The innocent people in Gaza? It’s truly very sad what Hamas is doing to them.  

But just like no one asked about the innocent Germans in WWII, enough with the double standard already. It’s exhausting. 

In war, innocents die. Israel didn’t want a war. It was forced upon us. 

Worried about the innocent people dying in Gaza? Then do something about it and stop yapping. 

Tell Hamas to stop using them as human shields. Tell Hamas to let them evacuate when the IDF tells them to. Tell Egypt to open its borders. Tell any of the tens of Muslim countries to take in their brothers. 

Turning to Israel as if Israel is responsible for an enemy state is simply dishonest and dangerous.

I have called for peace, a ceasefire, and even a call to at least allow the women and children to leave. I have never once said I'm pro-terror or pro-Hamas. 

This shows the lengths Israel will go to censor people who call for peace and spread fake news to remove them from their positions. 

An anonymous person wrote my ""employer"" three times in one hour with the title ""Please investigate this.""

First stating that I denied 40 infants were killed. 
The post she mentions has nothing to do with babies and I have never written about the babies. It was a direct screenshot from the DOJ, part of history that I don't feel Israelis would deny on how Britain was forced out of Israel by three Zionist terrorist groups.  

Second, she reiterates propaganda that again I think everyone would disagree, Israel like many countries was not started in peace. This is trying to influence my ""employer"" into thinking I am evil, picking on a peace-loving nation. 

The third message states something that has never been on my timeline and doesn't really make sense. These are obviously bot messages, one email is kind of true about the militias but the rest is out of place. My entire timeline never mentions those things.  

I traced the IP address and replied with an ip trace image embedded. The fact that this was a targeted attack with fake information and IP information
led me to believe this was with certainty an organized attack.

Victor Davis Hanson,1720185117178765489,4061,94,219,1806,Palestine,"Take Them At Their Words

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, at the UN in New York, just bluntly threatened individual American officials with violence: “I say frankly to the American statesmen, who are now managing the genocide in Palestine, that we do not welcome (an) expansion of the war in the region. But if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire.” (Emphasis added.)

I don’t think Mr. Amir-Abdollahian would come into our country to issue such a direct threat to American leaders had the Biden administration not assigned Robert Malley to reboot the atrocious but then-inert Iran Deal, had it not lifted oil export sanctions--resulting in a multibillion-dollar windfall to Tehran, had it not tried to ransom American hostages from Iran at $1.2 billion a captive, had it not restored hundreds of millions of dollars in support to the West Bank and Gaza, had it not allowed U.S. aid and remittance dollars to Lebanon to seep into Hezbollah coffers, had it not dropped past American  declarations that the Houthis were a terrorist organization, and had it not ignored rather than retaliated for dozens of attacks on US forces in Syria and Iraq by Iranian surrogates.

We should also take at his word one Ghazi Hamad.

He’s a high official in Hamas and one of their PR megaphones. And in an October 24 Lebanese television interview, Hamad  boasted: “We must teach Israel a lesson…and we will do this again and again. The Al Aqsa Flood [the October 7 attack] is just the first time, and there will be a second, a third, a fourth…It is Israel, not us. We are the victims of the occupation…On Oct. 7, on Oct. 10, on October one-millionth, everything we do is justified…”

Hamad was quite clear on the motivation for his envisioned million more murder sprees: “The existence of Israel is what causes all that pain, blood and tears.”

So Hamad is promising more beheading, executions, rape, and mutilation. I don’t think Hamad—apparently waging endless jihad against Israeli civilians from a safe distance in Beirut—got the message about the much-heralded American “two-state solution” of mutual co-existence.

In other words, Hamad has no problem adhering to the Hamas-charter agenda of wiping out Israel: “Israel is a country that has no place on our land. We must remove that country because it constitutes a security, military, and political catastrophe to the Arab and Islamic nations, and must be finished.”

So is this final solution to Israel the “from the river to the sea” envisioned by our campus activists?

Our Turkish NATO ally Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at a huge public rally, praised the Hamas mass murderers as “freedom fighters.” He declared the Israeli response to the Hamas apparat a “massacre,” and threatened to send the Turkish army to Gaza and to hit Israel with a swarm of missiles and bombs--or as he put it, his military can “come at any night unexpectedly.” (He issued the same sort of surprise aerial threat not long ago to NATO member Greece.)

Such is our Turkish NATO ally. It has the largest military of the alliance aside from the U.S., is home to a huge American air base at Incirlik that is reportedly still-equipped with nuclear weapons, has collaterally bombed Kurdish civilians in Syria and Iraq, and for the last half-century has propped up the permanent Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus that drove 150,000-200,000 Greeks from their homes. And, amid his denunciations of Israeli “genocide” and “massacre,” the moralist and former Obama conduit to Middle East, Erdogan sometimes talks about how an earlier Turkish generation dealt with the Armenians–as a matter of pride rather than shame.

Remember that all of these creepy leaders have at one time or another been (or currently are) recipients of U.S. cash, but are comfortably far away.

Ceux qui, dans les cabinets occultes ou les cabinets de conseil, pensent et élaborent les stratégies de communication. Car oui, avec Macron, on pense Communication only et pas intérêt des Français. Contrairement à ce qu’il se passe ici. Alors que faire pour enrayer cette perte de position ? Tout est permis et, comme au billard, des stratégies à plusieurs bandes. 

Souvenez-vous le 5 septembre 2023, le tribunal de Créteil refusait la requête d’une association qui voulait permettre au fondateur de WikiLeaks Julian Assange de demander l’asile « politique » en France, pays des supposées libertés. 

Cette décision très politique était d’ailleurs faite à Créteil, étrange, Valls n’est pas très loin et cela donnait certaines idées. Il ne faudrait pas que Valls, pour relancer sa carrière politique, ait joué des relations pour inciter la justice à se prononcer contre cette requête. Smiley clin d’œil. 

Mais les penseurs de Macron ont été plus rapides et lui ont suggéré, devant ses échecs à répétition en diplomatie, de jouer une dernière carte : sauver Assange pour sortir comme le héros. 

C’est une de ses dernières chances pour ne pas passer pour un censeur autocratique. Il est apparemment extrêmement jaloux d’@elonmusk comme Bernard Arnault qui, dans l’intimité, dit ne pas comprendre pourquoi il n’est pas aimé autant qu’Elon, étant aussi riche. 

@EmmanuelMacron lui a compris le coup à jouer. Il a envoyé Cédric Villani, en mauvaise position, aussi suite à la non-publication du rapport définitif sur les effets secondaires de la vaccination (on en reparlera). Donc Villani est mandaté en urgence pour faire le boulot pour lui. 

Comme il est tenu par le système, il n’avait pas le choix d’exécuter. Macron pense désormais être certain de se refaire une virginité en soutenant Assange. C’est sa dernière cartouche.

Tout faire exploser et tout aplatir est un régal pour les yeux. 

Nous devons parler du jour d’après.

Nous allons distribuer des parcelles à tous ceux qui se sont battus pour Gaza, et aux expulsés de Gush Katif ».

Ce sont les propos du ministre israélien du Patrimoine, Amichai Eliyahu, dans un post Facebook d’hier le 02.11.23, accompagné d’une vidéo de char aplatissant des ruines de maisons bombardés.

Rappelons aussi que Gush Katif était un regroupement de colonies israéliennes au Sud de la bande de Gaza, qui s'étendait sur une douzaine de kilomètres, dont les villages s'étaient établis après la guerre des Six jours,
Le Gush Katif a été évacué en 2005 conformément au plan de désengagement de la bande de Gaza.

Quelqu’un a encore un doute sur l’intention réelle du gouvernement Netanyahou ?

Ils vident Gaza pour s’y installer.

C’était évident depuis le début.

C’est maintenant dit publiquement.

I’ve yet to meet someone who says “it’s not that bad. It’s their fault and they deserve it”. I’ve met many who went believing Israel were the good guys and Palestinians screwed themselves over only to come back with an entirely disgusted view of Israel. 

I came back in a state of shock. I witnessed in real life things I had only read about in history books. Things I never believed a government could do in modern times. I had a neutral view of Israel prior to my trip. During my trip I was extremely skeptical and even pissed off several Palestinians with my lines of questioning. When I came back to the states and began processing everything… I couldn’t turn on the lights or get myself out of bed for a week. What I saw was unimaginable. It was a cruelty aimed at a group of generous and warm people with a very very clear intent- to get rid of them. And I couldn’t believe the group doing it to these people had it done to them not long ago. They took similar tactics and weaponized them against others. That is what I saw and I can’t unsee it. The children in the schools would stop me and beg me to come home and tell America to stop. They know it’s us allowing this abuse. 

Myself and everyone I know comes back disgusted with Israel. And many of us weren’t even in Gaza witnessing war. Everyday normal life for Palestinians is cruel and it’s 100% controlled by Israel. And despite what we’ve been spoon fed our whole lives, it’s not done because the Palestinians are violent and dangerous, it’s done to rid the region of them. To make their lives so miserable they either leave or violently rise up giving Israel an excuse to take more land. And the Israelis are not shy about this when you speak to them. Some might couch it with statements like “well we tried peace but they didn’t accept it”. It doesn’t matter how they phrase it, they still end up in the same place which is “they can’t stay” and “we want them gone”.",2023-11-01T09:53:00.000Z,@KimIversenShow,TRUE

They did. In 2018, thousands of Palestinians took part in 'The Great March of Return', demanding they be freed from Israel's blockade and granted their right of return to their ancestral homeland.

Over 70 percent of the population of Gaza are considered refugees, expelled from or descended from people expelled from Palestine in the so-called Nakba, Israel's ethnic cleansing of the land in 1948.

The protestors demanded right of return, and an end to the blockade of Gaza, which is illegal under law as a form of collective punishment but has persisted since 2006.

Israel responded by shooting the peaceful protestors, treating anyone approaching the fence around Gaza as a legitimate target - including children, the disabled, and medics. Human rights groups universally condemned this targeting of peaceful protestors.

Between the first protest and November 2019, more than 35 thousand protestors were injured, 7,996 with live ammo.

- The discussions include a daytime calm for several hours

- Hamas has not yet agreed to the terms of the potential truce

- Includes bringing 50,000 liters of fuel per day into Gaza

🚨MY THOUGHTS:

This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Here's why:

- I posted 2 days ago a warning by Hezbollah and Iran to the U.S that if there is no truce, or at least plans for truce in the near future, Hezbollah will join the war

- Since then, we saw very serious escalations across Iranian proxies in the past few hours

- We've also seen the rhetoric from the 'Axis of Resistance' shift

- Since then, today I put out a statement telling people in Lebanon to leave immediately, and I thought it is more likely than not that Hezbollah and allies will declare war on Israel.

- However, now that we have reports of a possible truce (which doesn't entirely surprise me), my level of concern drops significantly and my stance goes back to what is was prior to 2 days ago: Hezbollah is unlikely to join the war.

Things are changing by the hour. We will keep you all updated 24x7.

El Necio,1720040463392997805,1805,12,76,1096,Israel,"Cuba 🇨🇺 y Palestina 🇵🇸, dos pueblos hermanos bloqueados por EEUU e Israel

Cuba y Palestina son dos pueblos hermanos que son bloqueados por dos enemigos de la Paz y aliados entre sí, EEUU e Israel, que pretenden rendirlos por hambre para facilitar un golpe de Estado contra sus gobiernos, o directamente exterminarlos. 

A Cuba, EEUU le impone una guerra premeditada y sostenida en un tiempo de “paz” a través de un bloqueo económico de más de 60 años que mata lentamente al pueblo al privarle de las condiciones vitales de alimentación y salud, y que afecta a toda la sociedad en su conjunto; a Palestina, Israel la asesina a diario a través de un injusta e injustificada guerra y un bloqueo físico que también le impide acceder a sus necesidades más básicas; ambos bloqueos y agresiones se realizan con total impunidad a través del terrorismo de Estado que ocupa sus tierras, desplaza o desaparece a sus habitantes y a sus poblados, ataca militarmente y trata de impedir su supervivencia como nación.

Ante tanta agresión, las víctimas no sólo resisten y se defienden, si no que se solidarizan entre sí: la diplomacia cubana, basada en firmes principios de solidaridad y de respeto a la soberanía de los pueblos, siempre ha defendido a Palestina ante la agresión de Israel, sin importar el coste político; son muchos los maestros y médicos palestinos formados en Cuba que hoy resisten o mueren bajo las bombas de Israel, compradas a EEUU y a alguna que otra potencia occidental, como la española. 

Palestina siempre ha estado al lado de Cuba en la lucha contra el bloqueo y es aliada en la construcción de un mundo que cuente con los países empobrecidos del Sur. 

Históricamente, los líderes Yasir Arafat y Fidel Castro han estado hermanados en múltiples batallas diplomáticas, y sus discursos aún son recordados y estudiados al poseer una vigencia tan fuerte que sonroja a las potencias occidentales.

Pero los verdugos también se solidarizan en su política guerrerista. 

Cuba recibe cada año en la ONU el apoyo casi unánime de la comunidad internacional para exigir a EEUU que levante el bloqueo económico, comercial y financiero. Solo votan en contra EEUU e Israel. 

En su genocidio planificado, EEUU actúa como hermano mayor y protector de Israel en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, le da cobertura militar, política y económica.

 Además, el lobby sionista en EEUU es tan poderoso que condiciona la política interna del país norteamericano, como lo hace la mafia cubanoamericana de Miami, difuminando quién es rehén de quién, o incluso mostrando una complicidad perversa.

Por otro lado, Cuba y Palestina también reciben la solidaridad mundial frente a la barbarie de EEUU e Israel. 

Son numerosas las acciones que cada año organizan las organizaciones de solidaridad con Cuba y con Palestina, a pesar de ser estigmatizadas o silenciadas por la prensa corporativa. No es la primera vez que asociaciones de apoyo al pueblo palestino son señaladas por el Estado de Israel como terroristas, como lo es Cuba, incluida en una perversa y espuria lista que confecciona EEUU de países patrocinadores de esta lacra. Tremenda hipocresía la de estos gobiernos que sí patrocinan y financian el terrorismo, como lo sufrió Cuba desde el triunfo de la revolución en 1959, con 3478 víctimas mortales y con 2099 personas heridas, y como lo sufre Palestina en la actualidad, en la penúltima intervención militar sionista, que suma varios miles de asesinados, la mayoría civiles menores.

En honor a la Humanidad, por el derecho a vivir en paz, por Cuba, por Palestina, por los pueblos que sufren bloqueos ilegales e inhumanos aplicados por verdugos criminales de guerra que cometen delitos de lesa humanidad, éstos deben ser juzgados y condenados por la Justicia Internacional.",2023-11-02T11:29:00.000Z,@ElNecio_Cuba,TRUE

Azzam Mujahid Izzulhaq,1720292693262410098,1111,15,46,661,Palestine,"Pada 21 Agustus 1969, Masjid Al
Aqsha dibakar. Api dengan segera melahap sajadah, mushaf Al Quran, atap masjid dan beberapa bagian-bagian masjid yg terbuat dari kayu. Salah satu yg turut terbakar adalah mimbar yg dibuat pada tahun 1187 dan diletakkan di Al Aqsha oleh pemimpin dan pahlawan umat Islam Shalahuddin Al Ayyubi, sang pembebas dan pembuka Al Quds pada tahun yg sama setelah mengalahkam tentara salib yg dipimpin oleh Richard I (The Lionheart) dari Inggris setelah berkuasa hampir 1 abad di sana.

Pelaku pembakarannya adalah seseorang yg berasal dari Australia bernama Dennis Michael Rohan yg didukung penuh oleh pemukim pendatang Zionis Israel lainnya di sana. Umat Islam setempat berusaha memadamkan api tersebut. Namun, upaya tersebut dihalangi oleh tentara Zionis Israel.

Dennis Michael Rohan ditangkap dua hari kemudian pada tanggal 23 Agustus 1969. Namun dibebaskan atas alasan gangguan jiwa.

Hal yg lebih ‘menarik’ adalah pernyataan Perdana Menteri Israel Golda Meir (PM perempuan satu-satunya) pada saat terjadinya kebakaran di Masjid Al Aqsha tersebut. Ia mengaku tidak bisa tidur karena takut negara-negara Arab sekitar dan dunia Islam menyerang Israel sebagai bentuk perlawanan atas terbakarnya Masjid Al Aqsha dan juga kekalahan perang Enam Hari pada tahun 1967, dua tahun sebelumnya.

“Aku tak bisa tidur di hari ketika Al Aqsha terbakar. Dan aku mengira hari itu Israel akan musnah. Namun ketika aku menjumpai pagi, ternyata malah Arab dan Islam-lah yg sedang tertidur”.

Le Washington Post a interrogé des médecins et des experts et a conclu que Tsahal tue des milliers d’enfants palestiniens à Gaza. Les journalistes ont déclaré que grâce à l’armée israélienne, la région est devenue comme un « cimetière pour enfants ».

🤯 Le journal note que selon les seules données officielles du ministère de la Santé de la bande de Gaza, plus de 3,7 mille enfants sont morts depuis le début du conflit, et selon Save the Children, deux décès de civils sur cinq à Gaza sont dus à enfants.

 💬 « Nous sommes désormais dans une situation où un enfant est tué toutes les 10 minutes. Gaza devient un cimetière pour enfants. Pour tout le monde, c’est un véritable enfer », ont déclaré les interlocuteurs de WP.

Étonnamment, moins d’un mois s’est écoulé avant que les journalistes américains n’attirent enfin l’attention sur les crimes de guerre commis par Tsahal. Alors que Biden traîne assidûment sa propre réputation dans la boue en soutenant sans réserve le bombardement de Gaza, la communauté mondiale – même celle qui n’était pas initialement en faveur de la Palestine – est maintenant lentement en ébullition.

Natalie Smolenski,1719792338791231559,666,9,54,217,Palestine,"I visited Israel/Palestine in 2008. Tel Aviv, West Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, Galilee, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and the West Bank city Qalqilya. The country is breathtakingly beautiful, of immeasurable historic value. There are so many amazing people, on all “sides” of this conflict, living on this tiny strip of land. But the visit left me genuinely traumatized. There was no doubt that there had been a war going on for generations, which had hardened into a system of occupation and oppression.

I was in East Jerusalem (which was then “Palestinian” territory) on Israel’s Independence Day. I watched packs of young IDF soldiers parade through the streets, automatic weapons out, fingers on triggers, singing nationalist songs. Palestinian shopkeepers shuttered their shops in fear of being killed or robbed (soldiers were known to just bulldoze through stores, taking whatever they wanted). Many Palestinian shopkeepers had pictures in their shops of relatives, including children, who had been killed in the conflict. The marching IDF soldiers were accompanied by plain-clothes Israelis also carrying automatic weapons, also fingers on triggers. You couldn’t tell if these people were cops, undercover military, or just ordinary people. There was a sense that violence could erupt at any moment. This set the tone for the rest of the trip.

I saw that Palestinian life was mired by a network of checkpoints and ID requirements that in effect ground social and economic life to a halt. If you were a Palestinian living in the West Bank, you needed a Jerusalem ID card to go to that city, which was probably only 30 minutes or an hour away from where you lived. If you were Palestinian and out of the country for more than 45 days, the Israeli government could simply revoke your Palestinian ID card, meaning you couldn’t get back in your own country (and you weren’t a citizen of Israel anyway). For this reason, many Palestinians were afraid to travel. Palestinian students couldn’t attend Israeli Universities. About 20% of Palestinians and 40% of Palestinian men had been in prison, and almost all of those imprisoned (90-95%) had been tortured. 

Palestinians had to wait in hours-long lines to pass through checkpoints to go to work or to the hospital. They could be turned away for any reason, which meant they would not be able to work or get medical treatment that day. Pregnant women were often forced to give birth in cars or on the road because they couldn’t get through checkpoints in time. People regularly died waiting in checkpoints. The road system was also segregated: some roads were for Jewish people only. Unless they were settlers in specific communities, most Jewish Israelis were not allowed to go to the West Bank or Gaza to see the effects of the occupation themselves. The “separation fence,” ostensibly meant to separate Israel from the Palestinian Territories, also cut many Palestinian towns in half, forcing families and neighbors to go through an arduous checkpoint process just to see one another. In the West Bank city of Qalqilya, my friends and I saw an above-ground sewer that had had bars placed on the openings, so that people couldn’t even use the sewers to quickly get to hospital, which was in a different city. 

In the Palestinian village of Nazareth, where Jesus is believed to have grown up, my friends and I visited beautiful churches. We spoke with many ordinary Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian. I bought a bottle of the olive oil made in the town—it tasted exquisite. “You have to help us,” said the woman selling me the olive oil, pleading with her eyes.

In what is arguably the most liberal thing ever to have happened in all of human history, the Biden administration has announced its plans to develop a US National Strategy to Counter Islamophobia even as it helps Israel massacre Muslims by the thousands in Gaza.

“For too long, Muslims in America, and those perceived to be Muslim, such as Arabs and Sikhs, have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled attacks and other discriminatory incidents,” reads a White House statement on the announcement. “We all mourn the recent barbaric killing of Wadea Al-Fayoume, a 6-year-old Palestinian American Muslim boy, and the brutal attack on his mother in their home outside Chicago.”

This comes as the death toll from the US-backed bombing campaign in Gaza nears 10,000, including 3,760 children, in what experts and authorities around the world are describing with increasing frequency as a genocide. If these people were Jewish instead of Muslim, they would not be trapped in a giant concentration camp while the IDF hammers them with a nonstop barrage of military explosives, but because of their ethnicity they are subjected to this horror.

There’s a classic meme which makes fun of the way US foreign policy under Democrats is the same murderous foreign policy as it is under Republicans, but with a bunch of woke-sounding bumper stickers slapped on the surface to make it palatable for progressive sensibilities:

Can you think of a better illustration of the dynamic that’s highlighted by this criticism than what we’re seeing from the Biden administration today? This is after all the same administration whose Department of Defense recently said they are putting zero limits on what Israel may or may not do with the weapons it’s being given by the United States.

“We are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons that is provided,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told the press on Monday. “That is really up to the Israel Defense Force to use in how they are going to conduct their operations. But we’re not putting any constraints on that.”

As In These Times reports, this same administration is also trying to get permission to conduct arms deals with Israel without congressional supervision, in complete secrecy and without accountability to the voting public.

The US government is every bit as culpable in the massacre of thousands of Muslim children as Israel, because this entire massacre is happening with both its assistance and its express permission. But here is its government pretending to care deeply that one Muslim child was killed by an Islamophobic psycho in America.

This is everything that’s disgusting about the Democratic Party. It puts a warm, friendly face on the most murderous and tyrannical power structure on earth, posing as a defender of marginalized groups while dropping bombs on the most marginalized populations on this planet. It selects a high number of women and racially diverse officials for its cabinet positions to convey the illusion that it has transcended the abusive bigotries of the past, while subjecting impoverished brown-skinned foreigners to a nonstop barrage of high-tech explosive munitions in massacres that would be the envy of the worst white supremacist imperialists in history.

A much more accurate image for the United States than the one it tries to give itself with its fraudulent progressive virtue signalling would be the one it was given by protesters who interrupted Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday. Demonstrators painted their hands red to show the blood this administration has on its own hands, resulting in viral images of Blinken’s face surrounded by bloody hands circulating all over the internet.

That’s what the US empire really is. Not the liberal bastion of human rights it presents itself as, but a blood-spattered psychopathic murder machine which maintains its domination of this planet with the nonstop butchery of human beings.

The longer the massacre in Gaza goes on, the more people are catching a glimpse behind the plastic smiley-faced mask of the US empire and seeing the cold-eyed killer underneath.",2023-11-03T02:15:00.000Z,@caitoz,TRUE

1. Heavy clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters are ongoing around Gaza City, the most densely populated area in the besieged strip housing its biggest hospital and other key facilities.

2. Hezbollah said it launched simultaneous attacks on 19 positions in northern Israel, including two drone attacks in the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms. Meanwhile, Hamas’ armed wing in Lebanon launched rocket attacks on the northern Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona, wounding two people. Israel hit back with air strikes on south Lebanon.

3. An Israeli air strike killed Mohammad Abu Hattab, a reporter for Palestine TV, along with 11 members of his family in southern Gaza. He produced a television report just an hour before his death.

4. A group of UN experts said they “remain convinced that the Palestinian people are at grave risk of genocide”

5. Antony Blinken said that civilians were bearing the brunt of the war and that he would be working to prevent wider escalation during a trip to the Middle East later this week

6. Israeli air strikes flattened yet another residential block in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, destroying homes in the crowded Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Dozens were feared dead.

7. Four cancer patients died in Gaza after the last remaining medical facility designated for cancer treatment closed down due to lack of fuel

8. The White House is exploring the idea of “pauses” in the conflict to deliver aid into Gaza and seek to get captives out of the enclave

Jonathan Cook,1720068355007053832,8549,382,448,5061,Hamas,"What the BBC fails to tell you about October 7:

Kibbutz Be’eri has been a favoured destination for BBC reporters keen to illustrate Hamas’ barbarity. It is where Lucy Williamson headed once again this week. 

And yet none of her reporting highlighted comments made to the Israeli Haaretz newspaper by Tuval Escapa, the kibbutz’s security coordinator. He said Israeli military commanders had ordered the “shelling [of] houses on their occupants in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the [Israeli] hostages”.

Nor did Williamson refer to the testimony of Yasmin Porat, who sought shelter in Be’eri from the nearby Nova music festival. Porat told Israeli Radio that once Israeli special forces arrived: “They eliminated everyone, including the [Israeli] hostages because there was very, very heavy crossfire.”

Are the images of charred bodies presented by the BBC, accompanied by a warning of their graphic, upsetting nature, incontrovertible proof that Hamas behaved like monsters, bent on the most twisted kind of vengeance?

Or might those blackened remains be evidence that Israeli civilians and Hamas fighters burned alongside each other, after they were engulfed in flames caused by Israeli shelling of the houses?

Now let's clarify this issue.

Jews had already been living in the Holy Land for centuries. The anti-Zionist and anti-Israeli Jewish community living in Jerusalem Meah Shearim are Palestinian Jews who lived here during the time of the Islamic states.

Anti-Zionist Jews lived in peace and harmony with their Muslim neighbors before the establishment of Israel.

In fact, Jews and Muslims here would take care of each other's children and entrust their children to each other.

Anti-Zionist Torah Jews did not usurp anyone's lands or confiscate their homes like the Zionists.

In fact, Rabbi Moshe Hirsch, who served as the minister of the Palestinian state and was responsible for the Jews, took part in the Palestinian government.

Know well that anti-Zionist Torah Jews do not accept any aid from the Israeli government.

Anti-Zionist Jews in America established a relief fund for Torah Jews in the Holy Land and collected millions of dollars in aid.

Jews living here do not take their children to schools run by the Israeli state.

It represents the first time in history that a House Speaker has all but endorsed conditioning aid to Israel.  This is a dangerous precedent that cannot be allowed to stand.  

When I ran for Congress, I made it crystal clear that I would oppose anything other than unconditional aid to Israel—whether the attempts at  conditioning come from the far left or from the far right.  

The cheap cynical game that Speaker Johnson is playing sets a dangerous precedent for conditioning emergency aid. It represents a dangerous politicizing of Israel in a time of war.  It represents a dangerous decision to pursue division over unity and politics over principle.  

The House should vote on a clean bill, with no poison pills, that would send an overwhelmingly bipartisan message of unconditional unity around Israel.  Our ally deserves nothing less in its moment of greatest need. 

The Islamic Republic of Iran and its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas want nothing more than for the House to be dysfunctional, divided and distracted. Choosing gamesmanship over statesmanship, as Speaker Johnson has elected to do, will contribute to the further erosion of US-Israeli deterrence against common enemies. 

What is the point of voting on a cynically conceived bill that is dead on arrival in the Senate and that would be vetoed by the most the pro-Israel wartime President in history—the ONLY President to travel to Israel in a time of war?  

Speaker’s Johnson’s bill would have the real-world effect of not delivering aid to Israel immediately but of delaying it indefinitely.  This, to me, is as shameful as it is senseless.",2023-11-02T19:52:00.000Z,@RitchieTorres,TRUE

What you have seen now in Israel is exactly your act to support the terrorist Islamic Republic, not the people of Iran and our only representative, HRH Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.
Over the past several years, many highly educated Iranians have used HRH Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi's name to symbolize their longing for change and a return to the values and vision they associate with the Pahlavi dynasty. We are writing to bring to your distinguished attention the extraordinary and persistent endeavors of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose leadership has emerged as a beacon of hope and catalyst for transformative change among the Iranian populace. It serves as a reminder that many Iranians have not forgotten the positive aspects of the Pahlavi dynasty's rule, such as their efforts in modernizing and developing Iran. The Pahlavi era is remembered for its commitment to education, women's rights, and economic progress, among other things. 
HRH Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is the one and only representative of Iranians.

 American Senator Chris Van Hollen, during a Senate hearing on which the issue of providing assistance to Israel and Kiev was considered, emphasized that the situation in Ukraine cannot be compared with the crisis in Gaza caused by Israeli bombing, Mediaite reports.
 “Last night my wife and I learned that a man we know well lost two relatives and four of his children in a bombing in Gaza.  And they are not yet included in the latest death toll released yesterday by the United Nations, which said the death toll had risen to more than 8,300, 70% of whom were women and children, including 3,457 children,” Van Hollen noted.  .
 He added that, according to UNICEF, more than 420 children are killed or injured every day in the Gaza Strip.  The senator then asked Austin whether the US should ensure that American support is used in accordance with the laws of war and US law.
 Austin promised that Washington would point out to allies “the need to take into account civilian populations in combat zones.”
 When Van Hollen tried to ask another question, his microphone was turned off, justifying this with restrictions on the time of communication with the head of the Pentagon.

Kolom ini menjelaskan kenapa organ2 seperti Hamas dan jaringan Ikhwan Muslimin jadi musuh bersama negara2 Arab. 

Mengapa Hamas di Palestina, Ikhwan di Mesir, Hizbullah di Lebanon, dan Houthi Yaman, jadi duri dalam daging negara2 Arab. 

Karena agenda sektarian (khilafah) mereka mengancam negara bangsa. 

Presiden Mesir Anwar Sadat tewas di tangan tentara pro Ikhwan. Hizbullah menghancurkan Lebanon sebagai negara bangsa. Demikian juga Houthi di Yaman. Dan Hamas di Gaza.

Kelompok2 ini berkepentingan terus mengobarkan perang agama. Tujuannya menyeret negara2 kawasan ke dalam konflik berkepanjangan. Merontokkan batas2 negara bangsa.

Indian Muslim Friend: Pray for Gaza. Death to Israel.

Hindu: But Hamas started it. They paraded Israeli/ German women n@ked, butchered/ burned alive little children.

MF: That's resistance. When someone occupies your land, you are free to throw them out by all means.

H: Who occupied what?

MF: Jews occupied Israel - the land of Muslims - Palestine.

H: But Israel is land of Jews.

MF: Haha fake news. There was nothing known as Israel before 1948. US & west conspired against Muslims and occupied our land.

H: But Allah Herself calls Jews as ""children of Israel"" at least 40 times in Quran. If Israel didn't exist before 1948, was Quran written in 1949? Or is Quran wrong?

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: Still, Jews are occupiers of Muslim land of Palestine.

H: But there's no mention of word/ place called Palestine in Allah's book. So it's Muslims who must explain what they did to original Israel & its children mentioned in Quran that they were out of their land for 1400 yrs. If one party that's occupier here, it's Muslims, not the Jews.

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: Can't you see little kids in Gaza dying in Israeli attacks?

H: I also saw little Israeli children
K!lled by Islamists of Hamas. Islamists started it.

MF: 

H: Why silent?

MF: Innocent Muslims are dying.

H: Ok tell me, if Israel hadn't k!lled any Muslim in Palestine/ Gaza, would Allah have granted them Jannat? In holy book and Hadith, isn't it written that before Islamic judgement day, Muslims will k!ll all Jews and even stones & trees will help Muslims in the genocide? Even if Israel does nothing, their slaughter is certain?

MF: No Jew/ Hindu/ non-Muslim can get Jannat. Yes, k!lling of Jews before Qayamat is mentioned in our books. So what? That's Allah's word. But why are Jews k!lling innocent Muslims now?

H: So Jews should wait for the day when they get slaughtered by zombies and till then they must embrace you as brothers? And even after getting slaughtered, they'll be burned in eternal Islamic hell. Why shouldn't Jews defend themselves and preempt future slaughter today?

MF:

H: Why silent?

MF: You're a typical Hindutva genocide enabler.

H: And who are you?

MF: I am a proud patriotic Indian Muslim who rejected Pakistan in 1947.

H: So your ancestors were children of India?

MF: Haha, lol, Hindu! My ancestors came to India with Mahmud Ghaznavi riding donkeys. We Muslims conquered & ruled you for 1000 yrs.

H: So you're an outsider in India. Why shouldn't India throw you out, as, in your own words- ""occupiers are to be thrown out by all means""? Why shouldn't India do to you what you want to do with 'occupiers' in Israel?

MF:

H: Why silent?

Leandro Ruschel 🇧🇷🇺🇸🇮🇹🇩🇪,1720079085991243928,5583,45,90,1644,Hamas,"Pela primeira vez, desde que a guerra em Israel foi iniciada por um ataque terrorista covarde do Hamas, vejo evidência de um palestino apontando o dedo para quem de fato é responsável por tudo isso.

""A culpa é dos cães do Hamas"", disse uma senhora palestina, em sofrimento diante de pessoas mortas sob os escombros. Rapidamente, ela teve a boca tapada pela mão de uma pessoa ao seu lado, talvez por discordância com o que ela falou, talvez temendo a retaliação que ela sofreria dos terroristas.

A verdade é essa: os terroristas usam a população de Gaza como bucha de canhão. Instalam suas bases em áreas densamente povoadas, para evitar ataques israelenses, e para poder culpar Israel pela morte de civis.

Além disso, suprimentos enviados aos civis são desviados para suas operações terroristas. Um integrante do grupo afirmou que eles têm combustível, água e alimento armazenados para 4 meses. Eles tem roubado gasolina e comida enviados para hospitais e campos de refugiados. Chegaram ao ponto de destruir um novo sistema de encanamento de água para produzir foguetes com os canos.

Na semana passada, um líder do Hamas respondeu a um jornalista árabe, que perguntou por que o grupo não abria seus túneis à população se proteger contra bombardeios, dizendo que os túneis eram de uso exclusivo dos terroristas.

Quando Israel ordenou a evacuação do setor norte de Gaza, milícias do Hamas dinamitaram estradas e chegaram a atirar em civis que buscavam sair do local, exigindo que eles ficassem, expondo as pessoas aos bombardeios.

O Hamas instalou em Gaza uma ditadura obscurantista, que segue a Sharia, a lei islâmica que prevê a pena de morte a homossexuais, e o tratamento de mulheres como cidadãs de segunda classe, para ficar apenas em dois exemplos. Não há liberdade de expressão, não há representação popular, não há imprensa livre. A oposição é tratada a tiros.

Bu operasyonun görünmeyen kısmında çok ciddi bir hazırlık vardı. İsrail bu yenilgiyi hiçbir biçimde unutamaz. 

Elbette İsrail vahşeti ile ilgili hesaplar yaptık. Ancak dünya bilsin ki İsrail bu bayramlarının hemen ertesinde Gazze’ye büyük bir saldırı yapacaktı. Tuzağa düştüler. Şimdi bir yandan Gazze’yi bombalıyor, diğer yandan kendi içlerinde kavga ediyorlar.

Oyunu tamamen kendimiz kurduk. Hatta Mossad’a Gazze’deki durumla ilgili yanıltıcı mesajların ulaşmasını sağladık. İsrail istihbaratı ve ordusunu uyuttuk. O gece Yahudi Simhat Tora bayramıydı. Kutlamalar öncesi İç İstihbarat Birimi (Şabak) ve Mossad bir rapor hazırladı. Tel Aviv’e,Gazze’de ve sınırda konuşlu tümenin güvenliğinin hiç olmadığı kadar sağlam olduğu bildirildi.

Bu rapor sebebiyle ordu mensupları gece boyu içki içip sefahate daldı. Biz de onları o gafi l yakaladık. 1.200 genç, 12 bin kişilik siyonist tümeni dağıttı. Her açıdan onları kör ettik. Bütün elektronik sistemlerini felce uğrattık. Hacker’larımız sistemlerini çökertti.

Onlara tarihî hezimet yaşattık.

O gün ve sonrasında sadece askerlerle savaştık. Sivillere kıymadık. Maalesef 1948’den sadece İsrail’le değil, onların uşaklarıyla savaşıyoruz.

- Hamas is a religious, fundamentalist, extremist terrorist group committed to Israel's destruction and condemns other Arab Muslim nations for making peace with the Jewish State

- 750K Palestinians & 800K Jews were uprooted from across MENA after 1947. Some were expelled, others left voluntarily. The Jews were resettled as citizens of Israel. The Palestinians have been kept as political pawns by the Arab nations, and enabled by UNRWA. 

- Jews have lived in Jerusalem uninterrupted for 3,000 years. Archaeological evidence proves this. They did not create Israel ""for their safety."" They realized a 3,000 year old dream to re-establish (and decolonize) their ancient homeland.

- Your article implies that Israel has started many wars since 1948. That's patently false. In almost every case, Israel was attacked pre-emptively and successfully defended herself. 

- Israel gained control of the West Bank and Gaza from Jordan and Egypt, respectively. Both countries gave up their claims to the land. We can only guess that the 1947 designation @SkyNews is referring to is the partition plan that the Arab population rejected. 

- Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, not an occupied city. Israel's presence in the West Bank is governed by the Oslo Accords, since the Palestinian leadership continues to reject offers to conclude a final peace that would result in an independent Palestinian State.

Jonathan Cook,1720069600308580601,1527,39,85,883,Gaza,"What the BBC fails to tell us about October 7:

Consider the stark contrast in the western media’s treatment of events on October 7 and its treatment of the strike on the car park at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza on October 17, in which hundreds of Palestinians were reported killed.

In the case of Al-Ahli, the media were only too ready to cast aside all the evidence that the hospital had been hit by an Israeli strike, immediately Israel contested the claim. Instead journalists hurriedly amplified Israel’s counter-allegation that a Palestinian rocket had fallen on the hospital. Most of the media moved on after concluding “The truth may never be clear”, or even less credibly, that Palestinian militants were the most likely culprits.

In telling contrast, the western media have not been willing to raise even a single question about what happened on October 7. They have enthusiastically attributed every horror that day to Hamas. They have ignored the reality of utter chaos that reigned for many hours and the potential for poor, desperate and morally dubious decision-making by the Israeli military.

In fact, the media have gone much further. In advancing the narrative of “Hamas as savages”, they have promoted obvious fictions, such as the story that “Hamas beheaded 40 babies”. That piece of fake news was even taken up briefly by US President Joe Biden, before it was quietly walked back by his officials.

Similarly, it is still a popular throwaway line among the western commentariat that “Hamas carried out rapes”, though once again the allegation is evidence-free so far.

We should be clear. If Israel had serious evidence for either of these claims, it would be aggressively promoting it. Instead, it is doing the next best thing: letting innuendo gently sink into the audience’s subconscious, settling there as a prejudice that cannot be interrogated.

-------------  

Communiqué de presse du Recteur de la grande mosquée de Paris Chemseddine Hafiz en réaction aux critiques qui lui ont adressées suite à son passage sur BFM TV en compagnie du grand rabbin de France Haim Korsia : 

Chers frères et sœurs, que la paix, la miséricorde et les bénédictions d'Allah soient sur vous,

Des semaines avant notre réunion le 7 octobre dernier, le Conseil des Espérances a été la cible d'attaques, de diffamations, ou de tentatives de déstabilisation. Et cela continue. Cependant, loué soit Allah, notre projet et notre conseil restent unis, solides et élevés... et notre fraternité se renforce de plus en plus.
Cette fois-ci, je suis la cible d'une campagne mensongère, menée par des parties louches, motivées par des règlements de comptes honteux et des conspirations visant à ternir l'image de la Grande Mosquée de Paris et à diffamer ma personne. Le respect que j'ai pour chacun d'entre vous m'oblige à expliquer ce qui se passe.

Tout d'abord, j'ai participé avec le grand rabbin de France jeudi dernier à une émission de télévision française intitulée ""L'Appel à la Paix"". Mon objectif en participant à cette émission était de convaincre l'opinion publique et les politiciens français de la nécessité urgente de la paix à Gaza, de l'arrêt immédiat des tirs, de mettre fin aux bombardements meurtriers sur cette ville martyre, de protéger tous les civils, d'assurer l'accès aux aides humanitaires à Gaza, de lever le siège, et enfin, d'établir un État palestinien dans toute la signification du mot, permettant au courageux peuple palestinien de vivre en sécurité.  

Deuxièmement, je n'ai jamais commenté la nature terroriste du Hamas ou non. (Cela signifie que je n'ai jamais dit que le Hamas était un mouvement terroriste, ni le contraire)... J'ai dit qu'il serait injuste de dire que le peuple palestinien est terroriste. Ce qui m'importait, c'était de défendre les innocentes victimes, dont la majorité sont des enfants et des femmes, en raison d'une nouvelle agression meurtrière israélienne, s'ajoutant à d'autres attaques perpétrées par le passé.  

Mais le danger cette fois-ci est plus grand, car cette nouvelle guerre pourrait conduire à un nettoyage ethnique et au déplacement complet des Palestiniens de Gaza, avec des dizaines de milliers de morts.

Nous ne pouvons pas aider nos frères en Palestine par des discours émotionnels ou des surenchères rhétoriques. Nous devons savoir comment adresser le public avec raison et sang-froid. Les Européens doivent voir que nous sommes calmes, même si nous sommes en colère et révoltés. Nous devons savoir comment faire entendre notre voix dans le but de changer les politiques des gouvernements occidentaux concernant la terrible souffrance du peuple palestinien.  

Troisièmement, j'ai personnellement écrit le prêche du dernier vendredi, lu par 150 imams de la Grande Mosquée de Paris dans toute la France, priant Allah de libérer nos frères à Gaza, de les soutenir, et demandant justice et la fin de l'agression, rappelant les valeurs de l'islam en ces moments difficiles. Dans ce prêche que j'ai écrit, j'ai considéré la résistance du peuple palestinien comme légitime pour obtenir ses droits fondamentaux. C'est la position que je m'engage à prendre en compte et à soutenir devant vous.

Mais nous, en tant que dirigeants, voulons changer les choses en profondeur en Europe, pour pouvoir défendre les musulmans en Europe et ailleurs, en particulier en Palestine. C'est pourquoi nous ne pouvons rien dire.

Nous devons être prudents, avant tout, depuis le 7 octobre dernier, les mouvements politiques, et non seulement les extrémistes, aidés par certains intellectuels et médias, utilisent cette date pour attiser l'islamophobie et la haine envers les musulmans. La bataille que nous devons mener ensemble comporte deux aspects : surmonter la peur et la haine envers les musulmans en Europe et convaincre l'opinion publique du terrorisme meurtrier que subissent les Palestiniens, afin que les gouvernements européens agissent pour protéger Gaza et défendre la Palestine, en particulier en appliquant le droit international.

Le groupe a exigé la cessation des hostilités dans la bande de Gaza dans les prochaines 24 heures, menaçant sinon de déclencher une guerre contre Israël. Le chef du Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, promet d’annoncer une mobilisation générale des Libanais et d’organiser des opérations contre Tsahal « dans toutes les directions ».

❗️ Des escarmouches ont régulièrement lieu à la frontière entre les pays entre les militants de Tsahal et du Hezbollah, même si le Liban officiel a souligné sa réticence à entrer en guerre. Cependant, Tel Aviv a déclaré à la mi-octobre que le Hezbollah avait décidé de rejoindre le Hamas et qu’il « payait pour cela ».

Il est évident qu’Israël ne se soumettra pas à l’ultimatum du Hezbollah, estimant qu’avec le soutien des États-Unis, il a la force de combattre sur deux fronts à la fois. Cependant, les chances que l’Algérie entre en guerre sont désormais plus grandes que jamais, et l’Iran prépare également le terrain pour une confrontation militaire avec les Israéliens.

भारत ने UN में इजराइल के समर्थन से दूरी बनाई, क्यूँ? 
भारत को इस परिस्थिति में अपना पक्ष साफ रखना चाहिए, कोई हमास की इस क्रूरता को कैसे बर्दाश्त कर सकता है :बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू

-भारत ने 🇵🇸 को मेडीकल सहायता भेजी है 
-भारत ने 🇵🇸 को खाद्य सामग्री भेजी है 
-भारत में हमास का समर्थन देखने मिल रहा है
-फिलिस्तीन के समर्थन में बयान आ रहे हैं
-फिलीस्तीन के समर्थन में रैली निकल रही हैं 
-फिलिस्तीन के समर्थन में केंडल मार्च निकले हैं 
-फिलिस्तीन के समर्थन में सभा आयोजित हुई हैं
-सोसल मीडीया पर हमास फिलीस्तीन का जोर-शोर से समर्थन हो रहा है 
-भारत के हजारो लोग इजराइल को आतंकवादी वोल रहे हैं 
-भारत सत्ता विपक्ष फिलिस्तीन को समर्थन दे रहा है 
-भारत ने इजराइल की अबतक कोई अधिकारिक मदद क्यूँ नही की? 

-अब सिर्फ कुछ ही हिन्दू बचे हैं जो अब भी आतंकवाद के खिलाफ इजराइल का समर्थन कर रहे हैं, लेकिन एक बात बताओ हिन्दुओ कि आप अपनी सरकार के खिलाफ कैसे काम कर पाओगे 

-यहाँ तो हिन्दुओ की डबल ढोलकी पिट रही है, क्योंकि भारत के मुसलमान भी हिन्दुओ से सोसल मीडीया पर वहस कर रहे हैं, उधर भारत सरकार भी इजराइल के पक्ष मे नही जा रही है?

-इस परिस्थिति में हम किसी निर्णय पर पहुंचकर बुराई क्यूँ लें? 

-कौन है इजराइल के साथ इस देश में और क्यूँ नही है? 
-क्या भविष्य मे भारत का समर्थन कोई करेगा?
-इजराइल भारत के साथ हर मुसीबत मे खड़ा रहा है।

-भारत के मुसलमानो को भी 7 अक्टूबर के इजराइल पर हुए, आतंकवादी हमले का विरोध करना चाहिए था, जब्कि उल्टा ये आज हमास को समर्थन कर रहे हैं और हमास द्वारा झूठे फर्जी वीडियो फोटो शेयर कर रहे हैं, क्यूँ?

-जब 7 अक्टूबर के इजराइल पर हुए हमले का विरोध भारत सरकार कर चुकी है, तो भारत के मुस्लिम अपने देश की सरकार के साथ क्यूँ नही?
-क्या आप लोग आतंकवाद के खिलाफ नही हो? 
-क्या आप 7 अक्टूबर के उस आतंकी हमले का समर्थन करते हो? 
-क्या आप अपने देश के खिलाफ जाओगे?

This is MAJOR.

We were first to report 2 days ago that Hezbollah/Iran warned Israel through the U.S that Hezbollah will join if there is no ceasefire, or at least plans for a ceasefire (see tweet below)

This started materializing in the past few hours, as:

1. Hezbollah received weapons and reinforcements from Syria

2. An Iraqi proxy warned Israel and launched a drone against Israel (very symbolic, as it was from Iraq) 

3. Syria began preparing for a regional war (leaked documents)

Well, a few hours ago, we also reported of a potential 'temporary truce' between Israel and Hamas, again proving the accuracy of our initial report. 

This was the first piece of good news received in days.

WHAT'S NEXT?

In a few hours, Hezbollah's leader will be giving a highly anticipated speech that we will be streaming and analyzing.

My prediction is that, if no truce deal is reached, and Israel continues with the current strategy, Hezbollah will enter the war.

STATEMENT REFERENCED ABOVE:

Here's the statement by the Ebrahim Valipour, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Islamic Republic of Iran, Director of Department of Palestine and Jordan:

""From tomorrow, the Zionist regime's cabinet will have to accept a ground withdrawal from the Gaza region and accelerate the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.

If not, it should embrace the greater volume of attacks from the northern front.

The US will have to watch new equations in the region from tomorrow.

Nach Angaben der UN (UNRWA) wurden in den letzten 24 Stunden in Gaza vier Schulen beschädigt, die als Schutzräume genutzt werden.

Das israelische Militär hat Gaza-Stadt nach eigenen Angaben umzingelt und rückt weiter vor. Sprecher Hagari fügte hinzu, dass ein Waffenstillstand trotz internationalen Drucks „nicht zur Debatte steht"".

Der Vormarsch der Armee treibt immer mehr Palästinenser in Gaza-Stadt dazu, verzweifelt einen sicheren Zufluchtsort zu suchen, unter anderem im Al-Shifa-Krankenhaus.

Experten der Vereinten Nationen sind davon überzeugt, dass das palästinensische Volk angesichts der unablässigen Angriffe Israels „von einem Völkermord bedroht ist"".

Die Kämpfe an der israelisch-libanesischen Grenze zwischen Hisbollah und Israel verschärfen sich.

Der US-Senat hat 14 Milliarden Dollar zur Unterstützung Israels zugestimmt.

Das Weiße Haus denkt über temporäre Waffenpausen (nicht Waffenruhe) für humanitäre Hilfe nach.

Mittlerweile ist der 36. Journalist getötet worden.

Dunia🇵🇸,1719524799100133468,1762,102,57,1466,Israel,"Kafr Qassem Massacre:

In october 29, 1956 Israel was a military regime. It put a curfew on Palestinian villages(who has citizenship) at 9pm, including Kafr Qassem. But on this day, the curfew was moved to 5pm. This decision was taken at 1pm, the mayor of Kofr Qassem was told at 4.30pm. 

Hundreds of Palestinian workers were out in fields, unaware of the curfew. The Israeli border guard made no effort to tell the workers, what did the IDF commander Isaachar Shadmi say about Palestinians out past curfew? “I don’t want sentimentality; i don’t want detainees”.

When asked to clarify his words, he said: “may God have mercy on them”, he ordered to indiscriminately kill every Palestinian out past curfew.

In a truck…on their way home from the fields..47 Palestinian citizens were stopped by the Israeli border guard, they were lined up and shot dead.

Israel imposed a two month ban on media reporting on the crime,after outrage, protest and global pressure, 11 soldiers were put on trial and 8 were convicted, Israel tried to evade the crime by setting up mock trials for the soldiers, they were sentenced to 15-17 years in prison, then it was reduced until all soldiers were released.

But the worst part is Isaachar Shadmi’s trial. Shadami was acquitted, he was only found guilty of exceeding his authority in extending curfew, he walked free, only having to pay symbolic $ 0.01

When will justice be served?

She hated war and suffered from hysterical fear of the sound of bombs. The last thing she wrote on WhatsApp at 6 a.m. to her sister was that she was feeling her last moments.

When the bombing intensified, she sat with the whole family in the corner of a dark room, pale with terror, praying and repeating, “Allah is sufficient for us and the best of those on whom to depend.”

At 9 a.m., she took her last breath when a thousand-kilogram missile crushed her bones, martyring her along with her father, mother, brother, sister-in-law, and five other cousins.”",2023-11-02T19:53:00.000Z,@khalilo1,TRUE

""Los 2.000 jóvenes que irrumpieron en las puertas de Gaza el 7 de octubre de 2023 habían nacido en un campo de concentración. Durante dos décadas habían estado encerrados en una franja de tierra de 40 kilómetros de largo por 8 kilómetros de ancho que se encontraba entre los lugares más densamente poblados del mundo.

La gran mayoría de ellos nunca podría esperar salir sino sólo caminar cada día por el asfixiante perímetro del campo; nunca aspires a un empleo remunerado ni a comer una comida completa; Nunca esperes casarte o formar una familia. Abandonados por todos, fueron “restados” para languidecer y morir.

Para acelerar este proceso, Israel lanzó periódicamente “operaciones” que provocaron muerte y destrucción en Gaza: miles de personas fueron acribilladas metódicamente; hogares e infraestructuras críticas pulverizadas sistemáticamente.

Puede parecer el guión de una mala película de serie B, pero la noche del 6 de octubre cada uno de esos 2.000 hombres probablemente dio un beso de despedida a su madre y luego a su padre. Para siempre. Y luego cada uno de ellos prometió en silencio reivindicar la tortura implacable de una existencia crepuscular y vengar el asesinato de un abuelo, una hermana, un hermano, una sobrina y un sobrino por ese poder satánico que maldijo sus vidas"".

Nurfatoni,1720315434128572659,28,0,1,20,Israel,"Mengapa Tuhan Tidak Segera Hancurkan Israel? 

Oleh Anwar Hudijono, jurnalis senior tinggal di Sidoarjo.

PWMU.CO – Gregetan melihat kekejaman Israel terhadap rakyat Palestina, akhirnya keceplosan berucap “Mengapa Tuhan membiarkan Zionis itu merajalela. Kok gak dilempit saja. Kan Tuhan itu adil dan perkasa?”

Pertanyaan demikian wajar-wajar belaka untuk orang awam. Tapi akan berbeda manakala kita simak hakikat kehidupan yang sudah dicetakbirukan Tuhan.

Dalam cetak biru Allah kemenangan atua kejayaan dan kekalahan atau keterpurukan digilir antarmanusia.

Dan masa (kejayaan dan kehancuran) itu, Kami pergilirkan di antara manusia (agar mereka mendapat pelajaran), dan agar Allah membedakan orang-orang yang beriman (dengan orang-orang kafir) dan agar sebagian kamu dijadikan-Nya (gugur sebagai) syuhada. Dan Allah tidak menyukai orang-orang zalim.” (Ali ‘Imran 140)

Tujuan pergiliran itu untuk membedakan siapa yang kafir dan yang mukmin. Siapa yang adil dan yang dzalim. Dan membuka peluang mati syahid.

Selain itu untuk membersihkan dosa orang beriman. Menderita, sakit, lapar, terjajah, teraniaya itu cara Allah membersihkan dosa mereka. Bahkan luka tertusuk jarum pun menghapus dosa.

Juga cara Allah mau membinasakan kaum kafir.

“Dan agar Allah membersihkan orang-orang yang beriman (dari dosa mereka) dan membinasakan orang-orang kafir.” (Ali ‘Imran 3 141)

Dalam masa pergiliran itu juga dibuka peluang jihad dan sabar di mana keduanya adalah jalan ke surga.

“Apakah kamu mengira bahwa kamu akan masuk surga, padahal belum nyata bagi Allah orang-orang yang berjihad di antara kamu, dan belum nyata orang-orang yang sabar.” (Ali ‘Imran 3 142)

“(sambil mengucapkan), “Selamat sejahtera atasmu karena kesabaranmu.” Maka alangkah nikmatnya tempat kesudahan itu.” (ar-Ra’d 24)

Jalan surga itu sekarang terbentang luas di Gaza. Berjihad mengangkat senjata, membantu sesama, melakukan diplomasi melawan penindasan (fasad). Tentu saja sabar menghadapi ujian bertubi-tubi mulai kelaparan, terhina, sakit bahkan mati. Saat ini tidak ada yang kesabarannya melampaui rakyat Gaza.

Jadi dalam konsep pergiliran, saat ini rakyat Gaza yang mayoritas Muslim sedang dalam posisi kalah. Sedang Yahudi sedang dalam posisi menang setelah lebih 2000 tahun terpuruk.

Dalam posisi jaya atau menang ini Yahudi telah berbuat fasad, zalim, ugal-ugalan. Dan pasti akan menerima hukuman Allah atas perbuatannya itu. Itu sudah jadi ketentuan Allah yang terbukti berulang-ulang dalam sejarah manusia. Ingat Firaun, Namrud, kaum Ad, Tsamud.

“Dan kamu sama sekali tidak dapat melepaskan diri (dari azab Allah) baik di bumi maupun di langit, dan tidak ada pelindung dan penolong bagimu selain Allah.”
(al-‘Ankabut 22)

Kapan terjadi? Persisnya kita tidak tahu. Bisa saja terjadi dengan tiba-tiba seperti jika Allah turun tangan sendiri menghukum musuh-musuh-Nya.

Lihat, Firaun pasti tak pernah menduga kalau akan ditelah ombak. Umat Nabi Luth tidak pernah mengantisipasi akan hujan batu dan buminya dibalik saat orang tertidur lelap.

“Maka adapun kaum Samud, mereka telah dibinasakan dengan suara yang sangat keras.” (al-Haqqah 5)

“Sedangkan kaum `Ad, mereka telah dibinasakan dengan angin topan yang sangat dingin.” (al-Haqqah 6)

“Dan (ada lagi) karunia yang lain yang kamu sukai (yaitu) pertolongan dari Allah dan kemenangan yang dekat (waktunya). Dan sampaikanlah berita gembira kepada orang-orang mukmin.” (as-Saff 13)

Kita tunggu sambil riyadhah. Rabbi a’lam

Northern variant,1720182775758684441,494,21,32,119,Israel,"I actually have more respect for Islamists than liberal lefties. Islamists say what they mean and they mean what they say. When they say ""from the river to the sea"" they really do mean the destruction of Israel and the eradication of the Jews. Lefties, however, pretend it means something else.

As far as I can discern, lefties believe the state of Israel should be abolished because it's a ""racist, ethnonationalist, apartheid abomination"". But unlike Islamists, and because lefties never think through the consequences of what they say, they actually believe what replaces Israel will be a peaceful, progressive, secular state where Jews, Muslims and Christians all rub along nicely. This is their ""one state solution"". 

But we don't have to speculate what would actually happen. We have a living example of this exact dynamic emerging in real-time. Think South Africa.

South Africa was an actual racist, apartheid state. But it was also a functioning country. Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending apartheid, but what we've seen since is the rise of grievance politics (Marxism in a racial justice shroud) which, left unchecked, will see ethnic cleansing of whites from South Africa, the confiscation of their farms. On a long enough timeline, the water, telecoms and energy system will completely collapse under the weight of the corruption. The black factions will split, and split again, and then turn on each other, and then there's be a bloodbath and a famine in which millions die. We've seen this repeated across Africa where breadbaskets turn to basket cases. 

So imagine then what happens if the world decides to delegitimise Israel, the UN revokes recognition and the US stops supplying arms. In all probability Arab militias from neighbouring countries will move in, and they'll get to work cleansing the entire region of Jews. And when they're done with Jews, they'll go after the Christians and anyone else who isn't Muslim. And when they're done, they'll turn on each other. They probably won't even wait that long. Arabs hate Palestinians and Palestinians (being of diverse origins) tend to hate each other. Bedouins are viewed as the regions Roma. (Israeli Bedouins are safer under Israeli rule). 

Israel as it stands is a largely functioning country and the closest the region has ever got to a liberal democracy but what replaces it will not be a unified state of Palestine for Palestinians. It will be yet another corrupt Arab slum, where everything the Israelis built will be destroyed. The farms, the universities, the factories, the laboratories, the roads... will all be looted and left to fall into decay. Essentially a hybrid of Afghanistan/Libya and Lebanon. 

There are some on the right who say the Israeli-Palestine issue is none of our business, but Europe cannot afford this to happen. Israel's survival is very much in our interests. We saw waves of mass immigration at the height of the Syrian civil war, and we'd likely see similar. Half of Gaza would depart for Europe. That's the great irony of the Palestinian struggle. If they they had it their way, they wouldn't even want to live there. Israel is only a functioning and prosperous place because Israelis are nation builders. 

Arabs have never shown any such initiative in building the foundations of a Palestinian state. They embezzle aid, they destroy infrastructure, and blame Israel for their every failing. In all probability, the Palestinian state would rapidly descend into a state of civil war, probably destabilising Jordan in the process, resulting in a Jordanian civil war where the Hashemites brutalise Palestinians in a way the world has never seen. For a region that has been in a state of low grade war since before I was born, we would end up looking at the Israel era as a time of relative peace.

Lefties and Palestinians reject a two state solution because they ultimately want to abolish Israel. Israel rejects a two state solution because they know there is no genuine desire for one - and no observable efforts to build one. So a one state solution is the only solution on the table. 

So the question is, is it going to be a Jewish state where Jews can live in peace and safety, with at least some rights for Palestinians (better than Jews would have were the situation reversed), or one where Jews and Christians are massacred, that rapidly devolves into anarchy and destitution? If it's the former, then the fastest route to the best normal we will ever get, is the eradication of Hamas. If it's the latter, please just drop the pretense that this is about human rights and international law. Just admit you hate Jews.",2023-11-02T20:55:00.000Z,@FUDdaily,TRUE

Policing your border with disputed territory won in a defensive war isn't apartheid, and Coates dismisses Israel's security concerns like their nothing, while bemoaning the conditions in Hebron, which is a town that massacred its Jewish population in 1929 forcing the remaining Jews to leave. 

Apartheid is when you racially segregate your society and deny a certain racial group rights and freedom of movement. 

The West Bank isn't Israel proper. It's disputed international territory, and why would Israel allow a population who openly supports terrorism to freely enter its borders without security checkpoints? 

Ta-Nehisi Coates basically acts like Israel wasn't attacked by terrorist and isn't attacked daily by people brainwashed to hate Jews. piped.video/_df_u7yJj3k?si=OwN1…",2023-11-03T05:53:00.000Z,@COLINREESE,TRUE
