              " \"In the wake of the horrific massacre by Gaza-based terrorists of over a thousand Israelis, Israel‚Äôs Defense Minister @yoavgallant announced a ‚Äúcomplete siege‚Äù of the territory. Some have wrongly interpreted that to mean that Israel supplied, and is now cutting off, all of Gaza's water, electricity, & food. \\n\\nHere are the facts.\\n\\nWater:\\n\\nGaza is an oasis with its own water supply. But many Gaza residents have drilled wells wherever they wanted, leading to vast overuse and saltwater infiltration from the sea, and Hamas made no effort to stop this until 2021, when the aquifer's water quality had already been severely damaged.\\n\\nIsrael has long supplemented Gaza's supply by providing water through the Kissufim pipeline, and in recent years has increased the supply of water through new pipelines. In 2021, Israel supplied 14.4 MCM of water to Gaza, while 192.5 MCM was drawn from the aquifer under Gaza.\\n\\nSo when Gallant said Israel was cutting off the water, he was only referring to the approximately 14 MCM, and even that didn't last long - on October 29 Israel announced that two out of the three pipelines into Gaza had been reopened.\\n\\nElectricity:\\n\\nGaza mainly gets its electricity from the Israel Electric Company (subsidized by Israeli taxpayers), the power plant run by Gaza Power Generating Company which burns diesel fuel, and solar panels; Gaza is in fact a world leader in solar power.\\n\\nDuring the October 7 attacks, 9 out of 10 of the transmission lines that connect the Gaza power grid to Israel were cut. So apparently, some believe that even though Hamas attacks cut the power lines, Israel is obligated to repair them and then supply power to Hamas at its own expense.\\n\\nAnd while Israel stopped diesel deliveries to Gaza after October 7, Hamas is estimated to have enough fuel and supplies stored for months of fighting in their subterranean bases and tunnels; they could share it with the civilians they supposedly protect, but seem to have chosen not to.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nWhile Gaza did import food and other goods through Kerem Shalom, the crossing point was attacked by Hamas on October 7 and is currently a war zone. Moreover, Gaza produces more food than the local market can absorb and much of it is exported.\\n\\nAny food problems Gazan civilians are currently experiencing are not due to Israel's decision to impose a siege, but Hamas's decision to impose an all-out war on Israel.\",\n",
